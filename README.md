Website Source Code
================

This repository contains source code for my [personal website](https://www.simonpcouch.com/).

Thanks to [Abenezer Mamo](https://github.com/abmamo) and [Francesca Guiducci](https://github.com/engfragui) for the help in getting the back-end running!

To see the source code for my [blog](https://www.blog.simonpcouch.com/), see the [`blog` branch](https://github.com/simonpcouch/website/tree/blog)! The blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, with the Academic theme. I deploy my blog using Netlify. That setup is based on a fork of Julia Silge's website!
