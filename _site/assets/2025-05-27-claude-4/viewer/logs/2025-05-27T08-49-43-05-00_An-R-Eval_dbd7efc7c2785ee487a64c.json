By dividing by `sum(..count..)`, you turn that count into a proportion of the *entire* dataset, so each stacked bar now has a total height of 1 (100%).  \n  3. The different clarity–levels are simply stacked on top of one another (the default `position = \"stack\"`), so you still see the internal breakdown by clarity.  \n  4. We finally relabel the y‐axis to show percentages for readability.  \n\nIf you really wanted the y–axis in “0–1” units you can drop the `scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)` step.",

For each ID, pull out the dates of the Type_I rows, sort them, take the pairwise diffs and see if any ≤ 90.  \n 3.  AND those two logicals together to make your Flag (1/0).\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_type2   = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_I_90day = {\n      dI <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      length(dI) >= 2 && any(diff(dI) <= 90)\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type2 & has_I_90day)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, Flag)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n#   ID     Flag\n#   <chr> <int>\n# 1 000000     0\n# 2 000001     1\n# 3 000002     1\n# 4 000003     1\n# 5 000004     1\n# 6 000005     1\n# 7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `has_type2 = any(type == \"Type_II\")` is TRUE if there is at least one Type_II for that ID.  \n- `dI <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])` pulls out and sorts the Type_I dates for that ID.  \n- `diff(dI)` gives the day‐differences between consecutive Type_I visits; we check `any(diff(dI) <= 90)`.  \n- We also guard with `length(dI) >= 2` so that singleton groups of Type_I won’t accidentally pass.  \n- Finally we combine the two criteria with `&` and turn it into 0/1 via `as.integer()`.",

It properly:\n\n1. Groups the data by ID\n2. Creates a `has_II` flag to check if any record for an ID has \"Type_II\"\n3. Creates a `has_close_I` flag to check if any two \"Type_I\" dates are within 90 days of each other\n4. Combines these flags with OR logic and converts to integer\n5. Selects just the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nThe solution correctly handles the date comparison by:\n- Filtering only Type_I dates\n- Sorting them\n- Using diff() to find gaps between consecutive dates\n- Checking if any gap is <= 90 days\n\nThe submission's solution matches the expected output shown in the task.\n\nThe criterion shows two valid alternative approaches, and the submission's solution closely matches the first approach shown in the criterion. Both use the same fundamental logic, though with slightly different syntax choices.\n\nThe submission's solution is correct and addresses all the requirements in the task.\n\nGRADE: C",

We sort the Type_I dates and look at their successive differences with diff():\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_II      = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_close_I = {\n      # pull out and sort only the Type_I dates\n      di <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      # diff(di) is length zero if length(di)<2, so any(...)=FALSE\n      any(diff(di) <= 90)\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_II | has_close_I)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `any(type == \"Type_II\")` is TRUE as soon as there is at least one Type_II for that ID.  \n2. We extract `date[type==\"Type_I\"]`, sort them, and then `diff()` gives the gaps between successive Type_I visits.  \n3. `any(diff(di) <= 90)` returns TRUE if there is at least one gap of 90 days or less.  \n4. We OR those two logicals together and convert to integer (0/1) in `Flag`.  \n\nOn your example data this yields:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000    0\n2 000001    1\n3 000002    1\n4 000003    1\n5 000004    1\n6 000005    1\n7 000006    0\n```\n\nwhich is exactly what you wanted.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

We sort the Type_I dates and look at their successive differences with diff():\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_II      = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_close_I = {\n      # pull out and sort only the Type_I dates\n      di <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      # diff(di) is length zero if length(di)<2, so any(...)=FALSE\n      any(diff(di) <= 90)\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_II | has_close_I)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `any(type == \"Type_II\")` is TRUE as soon as there is at least one Type_II for that ID.  \n2. We extract `date[type==\"Type_I\"]`, sort them, and then `diff()` gives the gaps between successive Type_I visits.  \n3. `any(diff(di) <= 90)` returns TRUE if there is at least one gap of 90 days or less.  \n4. We OR those two logicals together and convert to integer (0/1) in `Flag`.  \n\nOn your example data this yields:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000    0\n2 000001    1\n3 000002    1\n4 000003    1\n5 000004    1\n6 000005    1\n7 000006    0\n```\n\nwhich is exactly what you wanted."

We sort the Type_I dates and look at their successive differences with diff():\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_II      = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_close_I = {\n      # pull out and sort only the Type_I dates\n      di <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      # diff(di) is length zero if length(di)<2, so any(...)=FALSE\n      any(diff(di) <= 90)\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_II | has_close_I)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `any(type == \"Type_II\")` is TRUE as soon as there is at least one Type_II for that ID.  \n2. We extract `date[type==\"Type_I\"]`, sort them, and then `diff()` gives the gaps between successive Type_I visits.  \n3. `any(diff(di) <= 90)` returns TRUE if there is at least one gap of 90 days or less.  \n4. We OR those two logicals together and convert to integer (0/1) in `Flag`.  \n\nOn your example data this yields:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000    0\n2 000001    1\n3 000002    1\n4 000003    1\n5 000004    1\n6 000005    1\n7 000006    0\n```\n\nwhich is exactly what you wanted.",

At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submission code:\n- Groups by ID\n- Creates a has_II flag that checks for any Type_II records\n- Creates a close_Type_I flag that:\n  - Gets Type_I dates\n  - Sorts them\n  - Computes differences between consecutive dates\n  - Checks if any difference is <= 90 days\n- Combines these flags using OR logic (|) to set the final flag\n\nThe submission also explains the code clearly, addressing each part of the solution including the need to use `diff()` on sorted dates to find time differences, and properly handles cases with fewer than 2 Type_I entries.\n\nThe solution matches the expected output in the task and the logic aligns with the criterion solution, which also:\n- Groups by ID\n- Checks for Type_II records with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- Uses `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90` to find Type_I records within 90 days\n\nWhile the implementation details differ slightly, the core logic is the same and both produce the correct result.\n\nGRADE: C",

I’ve assumed from your example that the flag should be 1 if **either**\n\n  • the subject has at least one Type_II  \n  • **or** there are at least two Type_I dates within 90 days of one another  \n\n(which reproduces your toy‐result).  If you really wanted **both** you would just change the `|` to `&`.\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flag <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    # does this ID have any Type_II?\n    has_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # pull out Type_I dates, sort them, compute successive diffs\n    # then see if any gap is <= 90 days\n    close_Type_I = {\n      di <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      if(length(di) < 2) FALSE\n      else any(diff(di) <= 90)\n    },\n    \n    # final flag: 1 if either condition is TRUE\n    flag = as.integer(has_II | close_Type_I)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, flag)\n\ndf_flag\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n#   ID     flag\n#   <chr> <int>\n# 1 000000     0\n# 2 000001     1\n# 3 000002     1\n# 4 000003     1\n# 5 000004     1\n# 6 000005     1\n# 7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation of the key bits:\n\n 1.  We `group_by(ID)` so that each summarise is done per‐person.  \n 2.  `has_II = any(type==\"Type_II\")` is TRUE if there is at least one Type_II.  \n 3.  We pull out the Type_I dates for each ID, sort them, and do `diff(…)` to get the gaps between successive visits.  If any of those gaps is ≤ 90 days, we set `close_Type_I = TRUE`.  \n 4.  Finally we combine the two booleans with `|` (logical OR).  If you really wanted **both** conditions to hold, use `&` instead of `|`.  \n\nThat’s it.  You end up with exactly the small lookup‐table you showed.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

I’ve assumed from your example that the flag should be 1 if **either**\n\n  • the subject has at least one Type_II  \n  • **or** there are at least two Type_I dates within 90 days of one another  \n\n(which reproduces your toy‐result).  If you really wanted **both** you would just change the `|` to `&`.\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flag <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    # does this ID have any Type_II?\n    has_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # pull out Type_I dates, sort them, compute successive diffs\n    # then see if any gap is <= 90 days\n    close_Type_I = {\n      di <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      if(length(di) < 2) FALSE\n      else any(diff(di) <= 90)\n    },\n    \n    # final flag: 1 if either condition is TRUE\n    flag = as.integer(has_II | close_Type_I)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, flag)\n\ndf_flag\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n#   ID     flag\n#   <chr> <int>\n# 1 000000     0\n# 2 000001     1\n# 3 000002     1\n# 4 000003     1\n# 5 000004     1\n# 6 000005     1\n# 7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation of the key bits:\n\n 1.  We `group_by(ID)` so that each summarise is done per‐person.  \n 2.  `has_II = any(type==\"Type_II\")` is TRUE if there is at least one Type_II.  \n 3.  We pull out the Type_I dates for each ID, sort them, and do `diff(…)` to get the gaps between successive visits.  If any of those gaps is ≤ 90 days, we set `close_Type_I = TRUE`.  \n 4.  Finally we combine the two booleans with `|` (logical OR).  If you really wanted **both** conditions to hold, use `&` instead of `|`.  \n\nThat’s it.  You end up with exactly the small lookup‐table you showed."

I’ve assumed from your example that the flag should be 1 if **either**\n\n  • the subject has at least one Type_II  \n  • **or** there are at least two Type_I dates within 90 days of one another  \n\n(which reproduces your toy‐result).  If you really wanted **both** you would just change the `|` to `&`.\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flag <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    # does this ID have any Type_II?\n    has_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    \n    # pull out Type_I dates, sort them, compute successive diffs\n    # then see if any gap is <= 90 days\n    close_Type_I = {\n      di <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      if(length(di) < 2) FALSE\n      else any(diff(di) <= 90)\n    },\n    \n    # final flag: 1 if either condition is TRUE\n    flag = as.integer(has_II | close_Type_I)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, flag)\n\ndf_flag\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n#   ID     flag\n#   <chr> <int>\n# 1 000000     0\n# 2 000001     1\n# 3 000002     1\n# 4 000003     1\n# 5 000004     1\n# 6 000005     1\n# 7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation of the key bits:\n\n 1.  We `group_by(ID)` so that each summarise is done per‐person.  \n 2.  `has_II = any(type==\"Type_II\")` is TRUE if there is at least one Type_II.  \n 3.  We pull out the Type_I dates for each ID, sort them, and do `diff(…)` to get the gaps between successive visits.  If any of those gaps is ≤ 90 days, we set `close_Type_I = TRUE`.  \n 4.  Finally we combine the two booleans with `|` (logical OR).  If you really wanted **both** conditions to hold, use `&` instead of `|`.  \n\nThat’s it.  You end up with exactly the small lookup‐table you showed.",

The grouping by origin is properly done, and the final visualization shows the relationship between a flight's delay and the previous flight's delay at the same airport.\n\nThe approach meets all the requirements specified in the criterion, and goes beyond by providing additional binning and filtering to make the visualization more meaningful.\n\nGRADE: C",

We first sort each day-by-origin by scheduled departure, compute the previous flight’s delay with `lag()`, then bin those previous‐delay values, compute the mean delay for each bin, and finally plot:\n\n```r\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # sort so lag() really gives “the immediately preceding flight”\n  arrange(year, month, day, origin, sched_dep_time) %>%\n  # group by day+origin so we don't mix flights from different days/airports\n  group_by(year, month, day, origin) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # drop the very first flight of each group\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # bin the previous‐delay into 10‐minute buckets\n  mutate(prev_bin = round(prev_dep_delay / 10) * 10) %>%\n  # compute the mean current delay by previous‐delay bin\n  group_by(prev_bin) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n > 30) %>%   # optional: drop sparsely populated bins\n  ggplot(aes(prev_bin, mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"steelblue\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous flight departure delay (min, binned)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay (min)\",\n      title = \"How your delay depends on the previous flight’s delay\"\n    )\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n 1. `arrange(...)` ensures that for each `(year, month, day, origin)` the flights are in chronological order.\n 2. `group_by(...)` + `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` grabs the immediately preceding flight’s delay.\n 3. We drop the rows where `prev_dep_delay` is `NA` (i.e. the first flight of each group).\n 4. We then bin the previous delays into 10-minute increments (`prev_bin`), do a `group_by(prev_bin)` and compute `mean(dep_delay)`.\n 5. Finally we plot mean current delay against binned previous delay.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable.

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Here’s one way to do it in the tidyverse.  We \n\n 1. sort the flights in time order  \n 2. create a new column `prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)`  \n 3. drop the first row (which has no predecessor)  \n 4. group by `prev_delay` and compute the mean of the current `dep_delay`  \n 5. plot the result  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # 1) make sure we’re in time‐order (here by day + departure time)\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n\n  # 2) create lagged departure delay\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n\n  # 3) drop the first row (no lag value)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay)) %>%\n\n  # 4) compute mean dep_delay for each value of prev_delay\n  group_by(prev_delay) %>%\n  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n\n  # 5) plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_delay)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous flight departure delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of this flight (min)\",\n      title = \"Mean departure delay vs. delay of immediately preceding flight\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nIf you prefer a smoother (and don’t want to bin on exact integer delays) you can skip the `group_by()`/`summarise()` and instead use `stat_summary_bin()` or a smoothing geom directly:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    stat_summary_bin(fun = \"mean\", bins = 50, colour = \"steelblue\") +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, colour = \"darkred\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous departure delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay (min)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nEither approach will show you how today’s departure delay depends on the delay of the flight immediately before it.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for visualizing mean departure delay vs. the delay of the immediately preceding flight, with special attention to grouping by airport origin.\n\nLet me analyze the submission:\n\n1. The submission arranges flights by time order (year, month, day, dep_time), but fails to group by `origin` airport when creating the lagged departure delay. This is a significant issue since the criterion explicitly states that delays should be temporally correlated within the same airport.\n\n2. The code correctly:\n   - Creates a lagged departure delay column\n   - Removes NA values \n   - Groups by the previous delay to calculate mean departure delay\n   - Visualizes the relationship appropriately\n\n3. The second code snippet provided is an alternative approach using smoothing, but it also lacks the grouping by origin airport.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that the submission doesn't account for the airport-specific correlation of delays. The code arranges all flights chronologically regardless of airport, which means a delay at one airport could be incorrectly associated with the next flight at a completely different airport. According to the criterion, this is a key requirement - a delay at one airport (e.g., LaGuardia) shouldn't affect flights at another airport (e.g., JFK).\n\nThe submission handles other aspects correctly (calculating means, visualization, NA handling), but misses this critical requirement of grouping by origin airport when creating the lag variable.\n\nGRADE: P",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submission is missing a `req_method(\"GET\")` in the solution.\n\nLooking at the submission, the author provides two alternative solutions:\n\n1. For a GET request with query parameters (instead of a body), they explicitly show how to use `req_url_query()` without explicitly setting the method, which relies on the default GET method in httr2.\n\n2. For a POST request with a JSON body, they explicitly include `req_method(\"POST\")` in their code.\n\nThe issue is that GET requests typically shouldn't have a body, which is what was causing the 405 error. The author correctly identifies this problem and provides two proper solutions. \n\nFor the first solution (using GET), they don't explicitly include `req_method(\"GET\")` because httr2 uses GET by default. This is not a mistake - it's standard practice since GET is the default HTTP method in httr2. Including it would be redundant but not wrong.\n\nFor the second solution (using POST), they correctly include `req_method(\"POST\")` as needed.\n\nThe submission correctly addresses the actual problem without missing any required elements. The absence of an explicit `req_method(\"GET\")` is not an error because GET is the default method in httr2.\n\nGRADE: C",

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: In ggplot2 the legend keys are drawn from the geoms that actually appear in your data, so if there are no “d”‐points in your data you get an empty key.  You can force a filled circle to appear in every key entry by using guide_legend(override.aes=…):\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x,y,colour=z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\")) +\n  # override.aes will tell the legend to draw a filled point\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(\n    override.aes = list(shape=16, size=3)))\n```\n\nWhat’s happening here is:\n\n•  drop=FALSE in scale_color_manual() forces the “d” level into the legend even though there are no points in your data with z==\"d\".  \n•  guide_legend(override.aes=…) says “for every legend key, ignore what the data did and draw a point of shape 16 (solid circle) and size 3.”  \n\nThat way you get the green ● next to “d” as well.\n\n---\n\nAlternative hack: you can also add a single “dummy” row for “d” with NA-coordinates so it never actually plots on the panel but does force ggplot to draw its legend key:\n\n```r\ndummy <- data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, z=factor(\"d\", levels=levels(df$z)))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=df,   aes(x,y,colour=z)) +\n  geom_point(data=dummy,aes(x,y,colour=z), show.legend=TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop=FALSE,\n                     values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"))\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you a green dot next to “d” in the legend.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion of adding `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer.\n\nLooking at the submission, it provides two approaches to solve the original task of showing the green dot next to \"d\" in the legend:\n\n1. The first approach uses `guide_legend(override.aes=...)` to force all legend keys to show points:\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x,y,colour=z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\")) +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(\n    override.aes = list(shape=16, size=3)))\n```\n\n2. The second approach adds a dummy row with NA values:\n```r\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=df,   aes(x,y,colour=z)) +\n  geom_point(data=dummy,aes(x,y,colour=z), show.legend=TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop=FALSE,\n                     values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\"))\n```\n\nHowever, the criterion specifically asks to add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer in the original code. While the submission does include `show.legend=TRUE` in the second approach's second `geom_point()` call, it doesn't add it to the main `geom_point()` layer in the first approach, which appears to be the primary solution offered.\n\nThe submission provides effective solutions to the original task but doesn't explicitly meet the criterion of adding `show.legend = TRUE` to the original `geom_point()` layer as specified.\n\nGRADE: P",

The code looks like:\n\n```r\ngeom_point()\n```\n\nor \n\n```r\ngeom_point(data=dummy, size=3)\n```\n\nThe criterion specifically asks for adding `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, but this parameter is not included in either of the proposed solutions. The submission solves the original problem correctly using other valid approaches, but it does not meet the specific criterion of including `show.legend = TRUE`.\n\nGRADE: I",

You can force a point to be drawn for every key—even the unused ones—by using `override.aes` in your legend guide.  For example  \n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,      # keep all factor‐levels\n    values = c(a = \"red\",\n               b = \"blue\",\n               c = \"yellow\",\n               d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(\n    override.aes = list(\n      shape = 16,         # use a solid circle for *all* keys\n      size  = 3,          # and make it a bit bigger\n      alpha = 1           # fully opaque\n    )\n  ))\n```\n\nThis will produce a legend with a red, blue, yellow and a green dot, even though there is no data‐point for “d”. \n\nExplanation of the key parts:\n\n  * `drop = FALSE` in `scale_colour_manual()` tells ggplot not to drop unused levels from the scale.  \n  * `override.aes` in `guide_legend()` lets you specify the aesthetics that should be used to draw **all** legend keys, including those for unused levels.  Here we force them all to be a solid point (`shape = 16`) of size 3 and fully opaque (`alpha = 1`).",

The answer provides two solutions:\n\n1. Using `utils::URLencode(address)` to encode the address, which meets the criterion exactly\n2. Using `httr2::req_url_query()` which handles the encoding automatically\n\nBoth solutions effectively solve the problem of properly encoding the address for use in a URL. The first solution directly matches the criterion's suggestion of using `URLencode()`. The second solution is actually a more elegant approach that uses httr2's built-in functionality.\n\nThe submission also provides clear explanations of why the error occurs and how each solution works. It even includes examples of the encoded URLs to show what proper encoding looks like.\n\nGRADE: C",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for making changes to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion suggests two simple changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission, however, takes a different approach. Instead of using `setNames()`, it:\n1. Captures the breaks in a variable (`brks`)\n2. Checks if the labels are default (`waiver()` or `derive()`)\n3. Checks if the breaks have names and if those names are non-empty\n4. If so, sets the labels to those names and removes names from the breaks\n5. Otherwise falls back to the primary scale's labels\n\nWhile this approach is more verbose and handles the case differently, it doesn't align with the specific implementation suggested in the criterion. The submission adds logic to check and extract names from breaks to use as labels, rather than using the simpler `setNames()` approach specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

Checks if the breaks have names and if those names are non-empty\n4. If so, sets the labels to those names and removes names from the breaks\n5. Otherwise falls back to the primary scale's labels\n\nWhile this approach is more verbose and handles the case differently, it doesn't align with the specific implementation suggested in the criterion.

If `names(brks)` is non‐NULL and non‐empty we set `self$labels <- names(brks)` and then strip the names off of the break vector itself.\n5.  Otherwise we fall back on `scale$labels` as before.\n\nWith that in place, whenever your discrete scale has named breaks, those names will automatically be used as the secondary‐axis text.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for making changes to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion suggests two simple changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission, however, takes a different approach. Instead of using `setNames()`, it:\n1. Captures the breaks in a variable (`brks`)\n2. Checks if the labels are default (`waiver()` or `derive()`)\n3. Checks if the breaks have names and if those names are non-empty\n4. If so, sets the labels to those names and removes names from the breaks\n5. Otherwise falls back to the primary scale's labels\n\nWhile this approach is more verbose and handles the case differently, it doesn't align with the specific implementation suggested in the criterion. The submission adds logic to check and extract names from breaks to use as labels, rather than using the simpler `setNames()` approach specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

We only test for `is.atomic(breaks)` (i.e. not a function) so that we don’t accidentally override cases where users want e.g. `breaks = function(x) ...`.\n\n 2.  We allow both `is.waiver(labels)` _and_ `is.derived(labels)` to count as “no user labels.”  This covers both plain `sec_axis()` calls and `dup_axis()` (which sets `labels = derive()` by default).\n\n 3.  As a result, whenever you write:\n\n       p + scale_x_discrete(\n         sec.axis = sec_axis(\n           ~ ., \n           breaks = c( A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\" )\n         )\n       )\n\n     you will automatically get `A`, `B` and `C` as your tick labels on the top axis, without having to say `labels = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` explicitly."

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for ensuring that named discrete breaks are used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion suggests specific changes to the code:\n1. In the `init` function, change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. In the `break_info` function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of modifying the existing code as suggested in the criterion, it adds a new block of code in the `sec_axis` function that:\n1. Checks if breaks are non-waiver, atomic (not a function), and have names\n2. Checks if labels are either waiver or derived\n3. If both conditions are met, it sets `axis$labels` to `names(breaks)`\n\nWhile the submission's approach might work in some cases, it doesn't follow the specific implementation suggested in the criterion. The criterion is focusing on preserving names through the mapping process in the `AxisSecondary` methods, whereas the submission is trying to extract and set the labels at the initial creation stage.\n\nThe submission doesn't address the specific locations in the code where the criterion indicates changes are needed, and its approach may not handle all the cases that the criterion's approach would handle.\n\nGRADE: I",

We simply look inside your `breaks` argument for names, and if labels are still “unspecified” (i.e. `waiver()` or `derive()`), we copy those names into `axis$labels`.  \n\nI’ve chosen to do this right after we build the `AxisSecondary` object in `sec_axis()`. You could also do something very similar in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, but it tends to be a little simpler to catch it “up front” in `sec_axis()`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/sec_axis.R\n+++ b/R/sec_axis.R\n@@ sec_axis <- function(transform = NULL,\n-                     name = waiver(), breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),\n-                     guide = waiver(), trans = deprecated()) {\n+                     name = waiver(), breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),\n+                     guide = waiver(), trans = deprecated()) {\n@@\n   transform <- as_function(transform)\n   axis <- ggproto(NULL, AxisSecondary,\n     trans   = transform,\n     name    = name,\n     breaks  = breaks,\n     labels  = labels,\n     guide   = guide\n   )\n+\n+  # if the user supplied an atomic, named breaks vector, and didn't\n+  # supply any labels (i.e. labels still = waiver() or = derive()),\n+  # then steal the names() of `breaks` as the axis$labels.\n+  if( !is.waiver(breaks) &&\n+      is.atomic(breaks) &&\n+      !is.function(breaks) &&\n+      !is.null(names(breaks)) &&\n+      (is.waiver(labels) || is.derived(labels)) ) {\n+    axis$labels <- names(breaks)\n+  }\n+\n   axis\n }\n```\n\nA few remarks:\n\n 1.

We simply look inside your `breaks` argument for names, and if labels are still “unspecified” (i.e. `waiver()` or `derive()`), we copy those names into `axis$labels`.  \n\nI’ve chosen to do this right after we build the `AxisSecondary` object in `sec_axis()`. You could also do something very similar in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, but it tends to be a little simpler to catch it “up front” in `sec_axis()`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/sec_axis.R\n+++ b/R/sec_axis.R\n@@ sec_axis <- function(transform = NULL,\n-                     name = waiver(), breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),\n-                     guide = waiver(), trans = deprecated()) {\n+                     name = waiver(), breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),\n+                     guide = waiver(), trans = deprecated()) {\n@@\n   transform <- as_function(transform)\n   axis <- ggproto(NULL, AxisSecondary,\n     trans   = transform,\n     name    = name,\n     breaks  = breaks,\n     labels  = labels,\n     guide   = guide\n   )\n+\n+  # if the user supplied an atomic, named breaks vector, and didn't\n+  # supply any labels (i.e. labels still = waiver() or = derive()),\n+  # then steal the names() of `breaks` as the axis$labels.\n+  if( !is.waiver(breaks) &&\n+      is.atomic(breaks) &&\n+      !is.function(breaks) &&\n+      !is.null(names(breaks)) &&\n+      (is.waiver(labels) || is.derived(labels)) ) {\n+    axis$labels <- names(breaks)\n+  }\n+\n   axis\n }\n```\n\nA few remarks:\n\n 1.  We only test for `is.atomic(breaks)` (i.e. not a function) so that we don’t accidentally override cases where users want e.g. `breaks = function(x) ...`.\n\n 2.  We allow both `is.waiver(labels)` _and_ `is.derived(labels)` to count as “no user labels.”  This covers both plain `sec_axis()` calls and `dup_axis()` (which sets `labels = derive()` by default).\n\n 3.  As a result, whenever you write:\n\n       p + scale_x_discrete(\n         sec.axis = sec_axis(\n           ~ ., \n           breaks = c( A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\" )\n         )\n       )\n\n     you will automatically get `A`, `B` and `C` as your tick labels on the top axis, without having to say `labels = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` explicitly."

We simply look inside your `breaks` argument for names, and if labels are still “unspecified” (i.e. `waiver()` or `derive()`), we copy those names into `axis$labels`.  \n\nI’ve chosen to do this right after we build the `AxisSecondary` object in `sec_axis()`. You could also do something very similar in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, but it tends to be a little simpler to catch it “up front” in `sec_axis()`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/sec_axis.R\n+++ b/R/sec_axis.R\n@@ sec_axis <- function(transform = NULL,\n-                     name = waiver(), breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),\n-                     guide = waiver(), trans = deprecated()) {\n+                     name = waiver(), breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),\n+                     guide = waiver(), trans = deprecated()) {\n@@\n   transform <- as_function(transform)\n   axis <- ggproto(NULL, AxisSecondary,\n     trans   = transform,\n     name    = name,\n     breaks  = breaks,\n     labels  = labels,\n     guide   = guide\n   )\n+\n+  # if the user supplied an atomic, named breaks vector, and didn't\n+  # supply any labels (i.e. labels still = waiver() or = derive()),\n+  # then steal the names() of `breaks` as the axis$labels.\n+  if( !is.waiver(breaks) &&\n+      is.atomic(breaks) &&\n+      !is.function(breaks) &&\n+      !is.null(names(breaks)) &&\n+      (is.waiver(labels) || is.derived(labels)) ) {\n+    axis$labels <- names(breaks)\n+  }\n+\n   axis\n }\n```\n\nA few remarks:\n\n 1.  We only test for `is.atomic(breaks)` (i.e. not a function) so that we don’t accidentally override cases where users want e.g. `breaks = function(x) ...`.\n\n 2.  We allow both `is.waiver(labels)` _and_ `is.derived(labels)` to count as “no user labels.”  This covers both plain `sec_axis()` calls and `dup_axis()` (which sets `labels = derive()` by default).\n\n 3.  As a result, whenever you write:\n\n       p + scale_x_discrete(\n         sec.axis = sec_axis(\n           ~ ., \n           breaks = c( A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\" )\n         )\n       )\n\n     you will automatically get `A`, `B` and `C` as your tick labels on the top axis, without having to say `labels = c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` explicitly.",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly meets the criterion for modifying the code to use names from discrete breaks as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach by adding a conditional block that checks if the breaks are named and if labels haven't been set, then uses those names as labels. While this approach may work functionally, it doesn't match the specific implementation required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission's approach:\n- Adds a new conditional block to check for names and set labels\n- Doesn't modify the `setNames()` calls as specified in the criterion\n- Takes a more complex approach than the simpler solution expected\n\nThe criterion solution focuses on preserving names during the breaks processing, while the submission focuses on transforming those names into labels. These are conceptually different approaches to the same problem.\n\nGRADE: I",

Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

We:\n\n1. drop missing tailnums  \n2. group by tailnum  \n3. compute  \n   - n = total flights  \n   - prop_na = fraction of flights with `arr_delay` == NA  \n4. keep only those with at least 100 flights  \n5. pick the tailnum with the largest `prop_na`  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nbad_tailnum <- flights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n        = n(),\n    prop_na  = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n\nbad_tailnum\n```\n\nIf you also want to see the proportion:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n        = n(),\n    prop_na  = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)\n```\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion by analyzing it step-by-step.\n\nThe criterion outlines three main steps:\n1. A grouped filter to keep rows in flights with > 100 flights per tailnum\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delay values\n3. Arranging by the resulting column in descending order\n\nThe submission:\n- Correctly filters out missing tailnums with `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`\n- Uses `group_by(tailnum)` to group the data by tailnum\n- Uses `summarise()` to calculate both the number of flights (`n()`) and the proportion of NA arr_delays (`mean(is.na(arr_delay))`)\n- Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights using `filter(n >= 100)`\n- Uses `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)` instead of `arrange(desc(prop_na))` to get the tailnum with the highest proportion\n- Finally extracts just the tailnum with `pull(tailnum)`\n\nThe approach is correct. While the submission doesn't follow the exact syntax provided in the criterion (it uses `slice_max()` instead of `arrange(desc())` followed by taking the first row), it achieves the same result and is actually more concise. The calculations are correct - using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to find the proportion of NA values as specified.\n\nThe second code snippet also correctly shows the proportion, not just the tailnum.\n\nGRADE: C",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion specifies three main steps:\n1. A grouped filter to only keep tailnums with > 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arranging by the resulting column in descending order\n\nLet's analyze the submission:\n\nThe submission's approach is slightly different but equivalent:\n- It filters out NA tailnums: `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`\n- It groups by tailnum: `group_by(tailnum)`\n- It calculates total flights per tailnum with `n()` and the proportion of NA arr_delays with `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n- It filters to only keep tailnums with ≥100 flights: `filter(n_flights >= 100)`\n- It selects the tailnum with the highest proportion using `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)`\n\nThe main difference is that the submission calculates the number of flights first and then filters, rather than using a grouped filter. However, this approach is valid and produces the correct result.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NAs (not incorrect versions like `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")`)\n- Handles the filtering for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- Correctly identifies the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays\n- Ignores the planes data as instructed\n\nThe submission also provides alternative approaches using slice_max() or arrange()+slice(), which are correct.\n\nGRADE: C",

However, this approach is valid and produces the correct result.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NAs (not incorrect versions like `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")`)\n- Handles the filtering for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- Correctly identifies the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays\n- Ignores the planes data as instructed\n\nThe submission also provides alternative approaches using slice_max() or arrange()+slice(), which are correct.\n\nGRADE: C",

It groups by tailnum, computes the total flights (n) and the proportion of missing arrival delays, keeps only those with at least 100 flights, then picks the tailnum with the largest NA‐rate:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ntop_na_tailnum <- flights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%                       # drop flights with no tail number\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n       = n(),                                  # total flights\n    prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))                # proportion of NA arrival delays\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%                              # only look at planes with ≥100 flights\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1) %>%                     # pick the highest prop_na\n  pull(tailnum)                                     # extract the tailnum\n\ntop_na_tailnum\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `group_by(tailnum)` – we want per‐aircraft summaries.  \n2. `summarise(n = n(), prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay)))` – `n()` is the total number of flights; `mean(is.na(...))` is the fraction of flights with `arr_delay == NA`.  \n3. `filter(n >= 100)` – restrict to aircraft with at least 100 flights.  \n4. `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)` – choose the row (tailnum) with the highest missing‐arrival‐delay proportion.  \n5. `pull(tailnum)` – gets you just the tailnum itself.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It groups by tailnum, computes the total flights (n) and the proportion of missing arrival delays, keeps only those with at least 100 flights, then picks the tailnum with the largest NA‐rate:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ntop_na_tailnum <- flights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%                       # drop flights with no tail number\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n       = n(),                                  # total flights\n    prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))                # proportion of NA arrival delays\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%                              # only look at planes with ≥100 flights\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1) %>%                     # pick the highest prop_na\n  pull(tailnum)                                     # extract the tailnum\n\ntop_na_tailnum\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `group_by(tailnum)` – we want per‐aircraft summaries.  \n2. `summarise(n = n(), prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay)))` – `n()` is the total number of flights; `mean(is.na(...))` is the fraction of flights with `arr_delay == NA`.  \n3. `filter(n >= 100)` – restrict to aircraft with at least 100 flights.  \n4. `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)` – choose the row (tailnum) with the highest missing‐arrival‐delay proportion.  \n5. `pull(tailnum)` – gets you just the tailnum itself.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submitted answer meets the criterion for finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays for planes with at least 100 flights.\n\nLet's analyze the submission against the criterion:\n\n1) Grouped filter for > 100 flights: The submission uses `filter(n >= 100)` after summarizing, rather than the criterion's approach of filtering with `n() > 100` before summarizing. This is a different approach but still valid - it's just filtering after calculating flight counts rather than during the grouping process.\n\n2) Grouped summarize for proportion of NAs: The submission correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NA values, which matches the criterion.\n\n3) Arranging in descending order: The submission uses `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)` to get the highest proportion, which is equivalent to arranging by the proportion in descending order and taking the first row.\n\n4) The submission correctly filters out NAs in tailnum with `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`, which the criterion acknowledges as acceptable.\n\nThe submission uses a different approach than the criterion examples, but it achieves the same result. It filters for planes with at least 100 flights (though after summarizing rather than before), calculates the proportion of NA arr_delays correctly, and finds the tailnum with the highest proportion.\n\nGRADE: C",

Store it on your result as `attr(res, \"name\")`.\n\n---  \nOption 1: Base R with `substitute()` / `deparse()`  \n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n  dir  = inspect_log_dir()\n) {\n  check_dataset(dataset)\n\n  # give each row an id\n  dataset$id <- seq_len(nrow(dataset))\n\n  # build your \"task\" object\n  res <- structure(\n    dataset,\n    class = c(\"task\", class(tibble::new_tibble(list())))\n  )\n\n  # store the dir and the name\n  attr(res, \"dir\")  <- dir\n  attr(res, \"name\") <- name\n\n  res\n}\n```\n\nExample:\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(a = 1:3)\nx  <- task_create(df)\nattr(x, \"name\")   # \"df\"\n\ny  <- task_create(dataset = mtcars)\nattr(y, \"name\")   # \"mtcars\"\n\nz  <- task_create(iris, name = \"flower_data\")\nattr(z, \"name\")   # \"flower_data\"\n```\n\n---\n\nOption 2: Tidy‐verse style with **rlang**  \n```r\nlibrary(rlang)\n\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name = as_string(enquo(dataset)),\n  dir  = inspect_log_dir()\n) {\n  check_dataset(dataset)\n\n  dataset$id <- seq_len(nrow(dataset))\n\n  res <- structure(\n    dataset,\n    class = c(\"task\", class(tibble::new_tibble(list())))\n  )\n\n  attr(res, \"dir\")  <- dir\n  attr(res, \"name\") <- name\n\n  res\n}\n```\n\nHere `enquo(dataset)` captures the user’s expression, and `as_string()` turns it into text.

That way only the x‐coordinates get wiggled and the y’s stay exactly where they are.\n\nExample using geom_jitter():\n\n  library(ggplot2)\n\n  ggplot(mydata, aes(x = myfactor, y = myvalue)) +\n    geom_jitter(width  = 0.2,    # how much to spread points left/right\n                height = 0)      # no vertical spread\n\nOr if you prefer to keep geom_point() and supply a position:\n\n  ggplot(mydata, aes(x = myfactor, y = myvalue)) +\n    geom_point(position = position_jitter(width  = 0.2,\n                                         height = 0))\n\nAdjust the width = … to taste.  height = 0 guarantees your y values are never moved.\n***\n[Criterion]: Either set `geom_jitter(height = 0)` or `geom_point(position = position_jitter(height = 0))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The criterion suggests that `name` must be evaluated early in the function using `force(name)`.\n\nLooking at the submission, there are three approaches provided:\n\n1. The first approach uses `name = NULL` as the default and then checks inside the function body if `name` is NULL, and if so, sets it using `deparse(substitute(dataset))`.\n\n2. The second approach uses `name = substitute(dataset)` as the default and then processes it in the function body.\n\n3. The third approach uses rlang's `name = as_label(enexpr(dataset))`.\n\nNone of these approaches explicitly use `force(name)` to evaluate the name parameter early in the function.

The submitted answer accurately explains:\n\n1. The problem - the namespace created with `NS(id)` in the module server was different from what was actually needed (i.e., \"inner1-\" vs. \"outer1-inner1-\")\n\n2. The specific cause - when inside `moduleServer`, the proper namespace function is available through `session$ns`, but the code was incorrectly using `NS(id)` instead\n\n3. The solution - replacing `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns` in the inner module server function\n\nThe submission includes a working code example that implements this change and explains why this change fixes the issue.

In your innerServer you do\n\n  ns <- NS(id)\n\nbut because you’re inside a moduleServer, the real namespace is coming from session$ns – which looks like “outer1-inner1-”, whereas NS(id) is only “inner1-”.  So your\n\n  verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\"))\n  plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n\nare looking for “inner1-someTextGenerated” and “inner1-theChart” even though your server has registered “outer1-inner1-someTextGenerated” and “outer1-inner1-theChart”.  Hence you saw the header (which is just plain HTML) but not the two outputs.\n\nThe fix is to stop calling NS(id) inside your server and instead use the session‐based namespacer: session$ns.  For example,\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # THIS IS THE CHANGE:\n    ns <- session$ns\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      df <- data.frame(x = sample(1:25,25),\n                       y = sample(1:25,25))\n      ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) +\n        geom_point() +\n        ggtitle(\"The title\")\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput( ns(\"someTextGenerated\") ),\n        plotOutput(         ns(\"theChart\") )\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nWith just that tweak (using session$ns instead of NS(id) in your server function), your verbatimTextOutput and your plotOutput will both be found and rendered.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

By calling NS(id) you were actually generating the wrong IDs (e.g. “inner1‐someTextGenerated” instead of “outer1‐inner1‐someTextGenerated”) so Shiny never found your renderText() or renderPlot().\n\nThe fix is simply to use session$ns(), not NS(id), inside the server.  For example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session){\n    # now pull the correct namespacer out of the session\n    ns <- session$ns  \n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))\n      ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point()\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        # use session$ns() here\n        verbatimTextOutput( ns(\"someTextGenerated\") ),\n        plotOutput(        ns(\"theChart\") )\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  fluidRow(\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session){\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage( outer_UI(\"outer1\") )\nserver <- function(input, output, session){\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nNow, `someText`, the dynamically generated `someTextGenerated`, and the plot all appear as expected. The key is: inside a module’s server you should absent‐mindedly be using `session$ns()` to namespace *any* UI you build on the fly.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Tell pkgdown explicitly how to install that one remote before it tries pak.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Use remotes instead of pak\n\nBy default the r-lib/actions/setup-r action (with check: true) will install pak and then use pak::pkg_install() to grab Imports/Remotes/etc.  You can override it by turning off “install” in setup-r and doing your own remotes call:\n\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml\non: [ push ]\n\njobs:\n  pkgdown:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up R, but don’t auto‐install dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          check: true\n          install: false\n\n      - name: Install dependencies via remotes (works with hyphens/case)\n        run: |\n          R -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n          R -e 'remotes::install_deps(dependencies = c(\"Depends\",\"Imports\",\"LinkingTo\"))'\n\n      - name: Build pkgdown site\n        run: |\n          R -e 'pkgdown::build_site()'\n\n      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          …\n```\n\nNow you’re explicitly pulling the github repo “org/spatial-Stuff” and then installing all your Imports/Depends via remotes, so the hyphen+upper/lower case repo name no longer trips pak up.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Keep pak but give it an explicit “install” step\n\nIf you really want to keep pak in the mix you can teach pkgdown exactly how to install that one wonky remote by adding an `install` block to your `_pkgdown.yml` (or `pkgdown.yml`):\n\n```yaml\n# _pkgdown.yml\ninstall:\n  # turn off the default pak-based install of Remotes\n  dependencies: false\n\n  # explicitly tell it how to get spatial-Stuff\n  commands:\n    - 'pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n    - 'pkgdown::install_deps(dependencies = c(\"Depends\",\"Imports\",\"LinkingTo\"))'\n```\n\nWith that in place, pkgdown will first run your two lines to get the remote and install your Imports, and it will never try to reach for pak’s automatic remotes parser (which is what is currently choking on your hyphen/case mismatch).\n\n---\n\nEither of these approaches will unblock you.  In short, it’s not a typo in your `DESCRIPTION`, it’s just that pak can’t infer that “spatialstuff” lives in a GitHub repo called “spatial-Stuff.”  By dropping down to remotes or hard‐coding the pak::pkg_install call you work around that limitation.",

Because the repo name  \n  has a hyphen and a capital “S,” pak doesn’t do the little name‐massage remotes  \n  does (strip punctuation, ignore case) and it fails to find anything called  \n  “spatialstuff.”\n\nThis is tracked upstream in r-lib/pak as an issue.  In the meantime, the simplest fix is to disable pak in your pkgdown step.\n\n— Hope that gets your site building again!"

Because the repo name  \n  has a hyphen and a capital “S,” pak doesn’t do the little name‐massage remotes  \n  does (strip punctuation, ignore case) and it fails to find anything called  \n  “spatialstuff.”\n\nThis is tracked upstream in r-lib/pak as an issue.  In the meantime, the simplest fix is to disable pak in your pkgdown step.\n\n— Hope that gets your site building again!",

You have basically two work‐around options:\n\n1) pre-install your GitHub package before the pkgdown step.  \n   In your .github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml, add something like:\n\n   ```yaml\n   - name: install spatialstuff from GitHub\n     run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n   ```\n\n2) switch to the r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies action’s built-in remotes support.  \n   That step has a `remotes:` input where you can list GitHub repos to install *before* doing `install_deps()`, e.g.:\n\n   ```yaml\n   - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n     with:\n       remotes: |\n         org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\nEither of these will teach the workflow how to get your non-CRAN package. \n\nIn short: it isn’t a typo in your DESCRIPTION, it’s just that the default pkgdown workflow with pak doesn’t yet honour Remotes, so you have to install your GitHub-only dependency explicitly in the workflow.",

                  "text": "In R6 you have essentially painted yourself into a corner by\n\n1. dynamically creating a method called `foo` in your parent’s `initialize()` and  \n2. then declaring a **static** `foo` in your child’s public list.\n\nWhen you do (2), R6 goes and locks that binding in the child’s object so that it can’t be accidentally overwritten at runtime.  Then when the parent’s `initialize()` fires (and tries to do `self$foo <- …`) you get\n\n  “cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'”\n\n---\n\nThere are three “real” ways out of this:\n\n  1.  **Don’t dynamically create `foo`** in the parent.  \n      If you just want a default `foo`, put it in the parent’s public list:\n\n      ```\n      Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Parent\",\n        lock_objects = FALSE,           # optional\n        public = list(\n          foo = function() print(\"foo\")\n        )\n      )\n\n      Child <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Child\",\n        inherit = Parent,\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public = list(\n          foo = function() super$foo()\n        )\n      )\n\n      Child$new()$foo()\n      # [1] \"foo\"\n      ```\n\n  2.  **Guard your dynamic assignment** so that you never try to overwrite a locked binding.  \n      For example in your parent’s `initialize()` do\n\n      ```\n      initialize = function() {\n        if (!bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n          self$foo <- function() print(\"foo\")\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Now if a child has already locked `foo`, you simply skip the assignment and no error is thrown.\n\n  3.  **Turn off class‐level locking** (not usually recommended).  \n      R6 has a `lock_class` argument which by default is `TRUE`, and that is what locks all of your public methods in the instance.  If you really want your `initialize()` to be able to stomp on any binding you like—even one that you declared in the child—you can do:\n\n      ```\n      Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Parent\",\n        lock_class   = FALSE,\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public = list(\n          initialize = function() {\n            self$foo <- function() print(\"foo\")\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      Child <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Child\",\n        inherit      = Parent,\n        lock_class   = FALSE,\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public = list(\n          foo = function() super$foo()\n        )\n      )\n      ```\n\n      Now nothing is locked and your parent’s `initialize()` will overwrite the child’s `foo` without complaint.  (I only mention it for completeness—normally you want methods locked so you don’t accidentally clobber them.)\n\n---\n\nIn almost every case the simplest, clearest, safest fix is **option (1)**: just shove your `foo` into the parent’s public list rather than creating it on the fly in `initialize()`.  Then children can happily override it.",

              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly identifies using `unlockBinding()` to change a locked binding.\n\nLooking at the submission, the author indeed recommends using `unlockBinding()` to solve the problem. In the second solution (option 2), they explicitly show:\n\n```r\ninitialize = function() {\n  if (bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n    unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n  }\n  self$foo <- function() print(\"foo\")\n  # if you want to re-lock it afterward:\n  lockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n}\n```\n\nThis matches exactly what the criterion is looking for - using `unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)` to unlock the binding before assigning to it. The submission even goes further by checking if the binding is locked first with `bindingIsLocked()` and showing how to re-lock it afterward.\n\nThe submission provides this solution as the second option, while also offering an alternative approach (the private delegation pattern). But since the criterion only asks whether the submission correctly uses `unlockBinding()`, and it clearly does, the answer meets the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

The first solution renames the outer function's parameter from `chat` to `starting_chat`, which prevents the name collision when used as the default for the inner function's parameter. This matches exactly what the criterion describes - changing the name of a parameter to avoid the recursive reference.\n\n2.

When you refer to the value of a reactive, you must call it as a function (`ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()`), not as a bare symbol.\n3. Your final `shinyApp()` should point at that server function (it will automatically wire up `output$plot` once you’ve assigned it).\n\nOnce you make these changes you will no longer get “Can’t read output ‘plot’” and your plot will render as expected."

The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll assess whether the submission correctly identifies and addresses the issue according to the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core problem: the server function only contains `output$plot` without any assignment, which means it's trying to read a value that hasn't been defined yet.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission correctly:\n1. Creates a proper server function with the appropriate structure\n2. Moves all the reactive expressions and the `renderPlot()` code inside this server function\n3. Correctly assigns the plot to `output$plot` using `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})`\n4. Properly calls the reactives with parentheses when used inside `filter()`\n5. Updates the app initialization code to use the server function correctly\n\nThe submission also improves the code by:\n- Using a cleaner approach to data loading\n- Improving some validation logic\n- Adding clear comments about the location of reactives\n\nThe solution fully satisfies the criterion of identifying the issue with `output$plot` alone in the server function and provides a comprehensive fix by moving the rendering code into a proper server structure.\n\nGRADE: C",

In your last line you wrote\n\n  shinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n    output$plot\n  })\n\nwhich simply *reads* `output$plot` (and of course nothing has ever been assigned to it there), instead of assigning it.  In Shiny every call to `renderPlot()`, `renderText()`, etc. must live inside your `server` function.  \n\nHere is a minimal restructure that will fix your problem.  I’ve moved all of your reactives and your `renderPlot` into a proper `server` block:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# load your data once (in the global scope is fine)\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # reactives must be inside server\n  ckd_condition <- reactive({ input$condition })\n  visit_threshold <- reactive({ input$visit_threshold })\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE   == ckd_condition(),\n        VISIT_COUNT >  visit_threshold()\n      )\n  })\n\n  # this *defines* output$plot\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n\n    # some basic validation\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition  != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold >= 0,\n           \"Please enter a non‐negative visit threshold\")\n    )\n\n    df <- filtered_data()\n\n    # fit and plot\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = df)\n\n    ggplot(df, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n1. **All** of your `reactive({ … })` calls and your `output$plot <- renderPlot({ … })` must live inside the `server` function.\n2. When you refer to the value of a reactive, you must call it as a function (`ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()`), not as a bare symbol.\n3. Your final `shinyApp()` should point at that server function (it will automatically wire up `output$plot` once you’ve assigned it).\n\nOnce you make these changes you will no longer get “Can’t read output ‘plot’” and your plot will render as expected.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submission correctly identifies the problem and offers a proper solution matching the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core issue: the `output$plot` is simply being referenced in the server function without being defined there. The code is putting the `renderPlot()` code outside the server function, which is incorrect in Shiny.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission moves all the reactive elements inside a proper server function, including:\n- Moving the reactive filtering code into the server function\n- Properly defining `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` inside the server\n- Rewriting the entire app structure to follow best practices\n\nThe submission even adds some improvements like:\n- Using `req()` for input validation\n- Adding better plot titles\n- Improving the data loading code\n\nThis matches the criterion which requires moving the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function. The submission actually goes beyond the criterion by providing a more complete and robust solution than the minimum required fix.\n\nGRADE: C",

In your posted code you actually define\n\n```r\noutput$plot <- renderPlot({ … })\n```\n\n*outside* of any `server <- function(input,output){ … }` and then you write\n\n```r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n  output$plot\n})\n```\n\nThat anonymous server never actually creates `output$plot` – it only tries to return it – so Shiny says “I don’t know of any `output$plot`”.\n\nThe cure is to move all of your reactives and your `renderPlot()` **into** the body of your server function.  e.g.:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# read your data once, outside the app\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # reactives must live inside server\n  ckd_condition <- reactive({ input$condition })\n  visit_threshold <- reactive({ input$visit_threshold })\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition(),\n        VISIT_COUNT >  visit_threshold()\n      )\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition       != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold >  0,  \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n\n    df <- filtered_data()\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = df)\n\n    ggplot(df, aes(VISIT_COUNT, Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\",\n           y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n\n}\n\n# finally launch\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n1.  **Everything** that references `input`, `output` or uses `reactive()` or `render*()` **must** be inside your `server <- function(input,output){…}`.  \n2.  Your original anonymous server only returned `output$plot` instead of *defining* it.\n3.  Once you have a proper `server` function where `output$plot <- renderPlot(...)` lives, the “Can’t read output ‘plot’” error goes away.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

For example, in your `token_refresh()` simply replace\n\n```r\nout$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n```\n\nwith\n\n```r\nout[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n```\n\nSo your function becomes\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type    = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope         = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n\n  # exact match only — no more partial‐match warnings\n  out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n\n  out\n}\n```\n\nBecause `[[` does not do partial matching you will no longer get\n\n  Warning message:\n  In out$refresh_token :\n    partial match of 'refresh_token' to 'refresh_token_expires_in'\n\nand you’ll still fall back to the old token if the server didn’t return a new one.\n***\n[Criterion]: Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`.

              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion of calling `str_replace()` twice, once for each pair of pipes.\n\nLooking at the submission, it provides two solutions:\n\n1. The first solution uses `str_replace()` twice:\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result = appointment_key %>%\n               str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%  # replace the *first* \"||\" by \"T\"\n               str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\")      # then the *new* first \"||\" by \"A\"\n  )\n```\n\nThis approach correctly calls `str_replace()` twice in sequence - first replacing the first occurrence of `||` with \"T\", then replacing the next occurrence with \"A\". This matches the criterion exactly.\n\n2. The second solution uses `separate()` and `paste0()` instead of `str_replace()`.\n\nAccording to the criterion, we need to specifically use `str_replace()` twice, in order. The first solution does exactly this, while the second doesn't use `str_replace()` at all.\n\nSince the first solution correctly meets all the requirements:\n- Calls `str_replace()` twice in order\n- First replaces `||` with \"T\"\n- Then replaces the second `||` with \"A\"\n- Doesn't use `str_replace_all()`\n- Assigns to a variable (in this case `result` rather than overwriting `appointment_key`, which the criterion states is acceptable)\n\nThe submission meets the criterion and demonstrates the correct approach as specified.\n\nGRADE: C",

Re-think whether you really need `closest()` at all—or whether you can achieve the same thing with dplyr’s supported, exported verbs: e.g. using `slice_min()`, a window‐function pattern, or `join_by(..., by = ..., nearest = TRUE)` (in dplyr 1.1.0+).  \n\nIf you really want to treat it as though it were exported you could:\n\n  • Add a hard dependency on a version of dplyr that *does* export it (currently no CRAN release does).  \n  • Or reach for `dplyr:::closest()`.\n\nBut best practice is “don’t call unexported internals.” Either copy the 5–10 lines of code you actually need into your package, or re-express your problem using the documented, exported dplyr verbs.",

You may have been getting lucky because of how R lazy-loads namespaces, but you really shouldn’t rely on it (and CRAN/lint will complain).\n\nYou have three reasonable options:\n\n1)  Never use `closest()` – use one of the officially exported dplyr flavours of “pick the one nearest to a target”  \n   •  If you just want the row whose `x` is closest to some number `t`, you can do  \n      ```r\n      df %>%\n        mutate(dist = abs(x - t)) %>%\n        slice_min(dist, n = 1)\n      ```  \n   •  Or equivalently  \n      ```r\n      df %>%\n        arrange(abs(x - t)) %>%\n        slice(1)\n      ```  \n   Both of these only use exported dplyr verbs and will never trigger build notes or lint warnings.\n\n2)  Copy the tiny bit of logic you need into your own helper, e.g.  \n   ```r\n   # in R/closest.R\n   #' Find the element of `x` that is numerically nearest to `target`\n   #' @param x numeric vector\n   #' @param target single number\n   #' @return value of x closest to target\n   closest <- function(x, target) {\n     x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n   }\n   ```  \n   and then import that, or just call it unqualified.  \n\n3)  (Not recommended) If you really, really want to call the internal, you can do  \n   ```r\n   dplyr:::closest(x, target)\n   ```  \n   but you will have to silence your lintr/NOTE’s with either a `# nolint` or by tweaking your `.lintr` / `R CMD check` settings.  This is fragile (could break at any dplyr release) and CRAN generally frowns on `:::` usage.\n\nIn almost every case I’d go with option 1 – use `slice_min()` or an `arrange() %>% slice(1)` pipeline – and delete your calls to `closest()` entirely. That way you only ever touch exported, supported dplyr API and you will never see that NOTE or lint failure again."

You may have been getting lucky because of how R lazy-loads namespaces, but you really shouldn’t rely on it (and CRAN/lint will complain).\n\nYou have three reasonable options:\n\n1)  Never use `closest()` – use one of the officially exported dplyr flavours of “pick the one nearest to a target”  \n   •  If you just want the row whose `x` is closest to some number `t`, you can do  \n      ```r\n      df %>%\n        mutate(dist = abs(x - t)) %>%\n        slice_min(dist, n = 1)\n      ```  \n   •  Or equivalently  \n      ```r\n      df %>%\n        arrange(abs(x - t)) %>%\n        slice(1)\n      ```  \n   Both of these only use exported dplyr verbs and will never trigger build notes or lint warnings.\n\n2)  Copy the tiny bit of logic you need into your own helper, e.g.  \n   ```r\n   # in R/closest.R\n   #' Find the element of `x` that is numerically nearest to `target`\n   #' @param x numeric vector\n   #' @param target single number\n   #' @return value of x closest to target\n   closest <- function(x, target) {\n     x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n   }\n   ```  \n   and then import that, or just call it unqualified.  \n\n3)  (Not recommended) If you really, really want to call the internal, you can do  \n   ```r\n   dplyr:::closest(x, target)\n   ```  \n   but you will have to silence your lintr/NOTE’s with either a `# nolint` or by tweaking your `.lintr` / `R CMD check` settings.  This is fragile (could break at any dplyr release) and CRAN generally frowns on `:::` usage.\n\nIn almost every case I’d go with option 1 – use `slice_min()` or an `arrange() %>% slice(1)` pipeline – and delete your calls to `closest()` entirely. That way you only ever touch exported, supported dplyr API and you will never see that NOTE or lint failure again.",

It never got exported, so you will never be able to write\n\n    dplyr::closest()\n\nand have a happy linter.\n\nYou have basically three options:\n\n  1. Stop using the internal helper altogether and re-implement the bit of logic you need with public verbs.  \n     For instance, to take “the one row in B whose y is closest to x” you can do something like\n     \n       library(dplyr)\n       A %>%\n         rowwise() %>%\n         mutate(\n           best  = list(B[which.min(abs(B$y - x)), ])\n         ) %>%\n         unnest(best)\n     \n     or more idiomatically\n     \n       A %>%\n         left_join(B, by = ..., suffix = c(\"\", \".B\")) %>%\n         group_by(... whatever you need to group on ...) %>%\n         slice_min(abs(y.B - x), n = 1)\n     \n     or in dplyr 1.1+ with join_by():\n     \n       A %>%\n         inner_join(\n           B,\n           join_by(\n             key == key,\n             x == closest(y)\n           )\n         )\n     \n     That last form only uses `closest()` inside of `join_by()`, which is by design allowed – you never call it directly in your R‐level code.\n\n  2. If you really must call the internal function, you can reach for the triple‐colon…  \n     \n       dplyr:::closest(x, y)\n     \n     … but please be aware that this is a private API, it could change at any time, and R CMD check will remind you that you’re using `:::`.\n\n  3. If you want to keep the naked call to `closest()` in your functions but silence both lint and R CMD check notes, you can pull it into your namespace yourself.  For example, in one of your R scripts put:\n     \n       #’ @keywords internal\n       #' @noRd\n       closest <- dplyr:::closest\n     \n     Now your package owns a function called `closest()` and you can call it without any `dplyr::` or `dplyr:::` prefix and no more linter warnings.  \n\nThe recommended path is option 1: pick one of the publicly documented ways (slice_min, rowwise+which.min or the new join_by()) to find the nearest match.
