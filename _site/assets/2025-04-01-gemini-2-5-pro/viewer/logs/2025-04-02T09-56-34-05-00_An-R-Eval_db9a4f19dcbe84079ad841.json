          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for changing the code to show proportions instead of counts.\n\nThe submission suggests using `position = \"fill\"` to modify the bar chart. According to the criterion, this approach is not correct because:\n\n1. With `position = \"fill\"`, each bar would have a height of 1, showing only the proportion of clarity types *within* each cut category.\n\n2. The criterion specifically states that the correct approach is to use `after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count))` (or the older `..count.. / sum(..count..)` notation), which would show the proportion of diamonds with a given cut relative to the total number of diamonds.\n\nThe submission is incorrectly interpreting the task. The task asks for \"the proportion of diamonds with a given cut\" to correspond to bar height, which means each bar should show what fraction of all diamonds have that particular cut. The `position = \"fill\"` approach instead normalizes within each cut category, showing the distribution of clarity within each cut.\n\nSince the submission uses an approach explicitly identified as incorrect in the criterion, and doesn't use the required calculation method to show the proper proportions:\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion based on calculating the proportion of diamonds with a given cut out of all diamonds.\n\nThe criterion specifies that we want each bar to represent the proportion of all diamonds that have a specific cut (e.g., what percentage of all diamonds are \"Fair\", what percentage are \"Good\", etc.). This requires dividing the count of each cut by the total count of all diamonds.\n\nThe suggested solution in the criterion uses:\n```\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count)), fill = clarity))\n```\n\nThe submission instead suggests:\n```\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = \"fill\")\n```\n\nThe problem with the submission's approach is that `position = \"fill\"` normalizes each cut category separately, making each bar's height 1.0 (or 100%). This shows the proportion of clarity levels within each cut, but doesn't show the proportion of each cut relative to all diamonds.\n\nFor example, with `position = \"fill\"`:\n- If \"Fair\" cut is 10% of all diamonds, its bar would still be full height (1.0)\n- If \"Ideal\" cut is 40% of all diamonds, its bar would also be full height (1.0)\n\nThis doesn't match the task's requirement of showing \"the proportion of diamonds with a given cut corresponds to the bar height.\"\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submitted solution correctly implements the requested functionality according to the criterion.\n\nThe submitted solution correctly:\n1. Groups by ID\n2. Checks for the presence of \"Type_II\" records\n3. Checks for multiple \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n4. Combines these conditions with a logical OR\n5. Converts the boolean result to an integer flag\n\nHowever, there is a logical issue in the implementation. The way the condition for multiple \"Type_I\" records is checked doesn't fully match what's described in the criterion. The criterion solutions use `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` which correctly checks if any consecutive dates are within 90 days.\n\nThe submitted solution's approach using `any(diff(type_I_dates) <= 90)` is close but doesn't explicitly ensure that there are \"two or more cases\" of Type_I - though the logic in the if statement does handle this by checking `length(type_I_dates) < 2`.\n\nThe solution is functionally correct and would produce the expected results for the given dataset, but the implementation is slightly more verbose than the criterion examples.\n\nGRADE: C",

`has_type_II`: Simple check for any \"Type_II\" records\n   - `has_multiple_type_I_in_90_days`: More complex check that:\n     - Extracts dates where type is \"Type_I\"\n     - If there are fewer than 2 Type_I records, returns FALSE\n     - Otherwise, sorts the dates and checks if any consecutive dates have a difference of 90 days or less\n\n3. **Combine conditions**: We set the Flag to 1 if either condition is TRUE, 0 otherwise.\n\n4. **Clean up**: We remove the intermediate columns, leaving only ID and Flag.\n\nThis solution correctly identifies patients meeting either of the criteria and matches your expected output.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Groups by ID\n2. Checks for the presence of \"Type_II\" records\n3. Checks for multiple \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n4. Combines these conditions with a logical OR\n5. Converts the boolean result to an integer flag\n\nHowever, there is a logical issue in the implementation. The way the condition for multiple \"Type_I\" records is checked doesn't fully match what's described in the criterion. The criterion solutions use `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` which correctly checks if any consecutive dates are within 90 days.\n\nThe submitted solution's approach using `any(diff(type_I_dates) <= 90)` is close but doesn't explicitly ensure that there are \"two or more cases\" of Type_I - though the logic in the if statement does handle this by checking `length(type_I_dates) < 2`.\n\nThe solution is functionally correct and would produce the expected results for the given dataset, but the implementation is slightly more verbose than the criterion examples.\n\nGRADE: C"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted solution meets the criterion for setting a conditional boolean flag based on the specified criteria.\n\nThe submitted solution correctly:\n\n1. Uses the tidyverse approach as requested\n2. Groups the data by ID\n3. Checks for the first condition: at least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n4. Checks for the second condition: two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n5. Sets the Flag to 1 if either condition is met, 0 otherwise\n\nThe logic in the code is sound. For the \"Type_II\" check, it uses `any(type == \"Type_II\")`. For the \"Type_I\" within 90 days check, it:\n- Extracts dates for \"Type_I\" entries\n- Checks if there are at least 2 entries (necessary for the comparison)\n- Sorts the dates\n- Uses `diff()` to check if any consecutive dates are within 90 days of each other\n\nThe solution's approach is technically correct and follows the expected logic to solve the problem. It will produce the expected output as shown in the task, properly identifying the IDs that meet either criterion.\n\nThe criterion shows two possible solutions, and while the submitted solution doesn't match either of them exactly, it follows the same logical approach as the first solution. The differences are primarily in coding style rather than logic.\n\nGRADE: C",

Groups the data by ID\n2.

Selects only the ID and Flag columns for the final output\n\nThe result should match your expected output, correctly identifying IDs 000001, 000002, 000003, 000004, and 000005 as meeting the criteria.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Checks for the second condition: two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n5. Sets the Flag to 1 if either condition is met, 0 otherwise\n\nThe logic in the code is sound. For the \"Type_II\" check, it uses `any(type == \"Type_II\")`. For the \"Type_I\" within 90 days check, it:\n- Extracts dates for \"Type_I\" entries\n- Checks if there are at least 2 entries (necessary for the comparison)\n- Sorts the dates\n- Uses `diff()` to check if any consecutive dates are within 90 days of each other\n\nThe solution's approach is technically correct and follows the expected logic to solve the problem. It will produce the expected output as shown in the task, properly identifying the IDs that meet either criterion.\n\nThe criterion shows two possible solutions, and while the submitted solution doesn't match either of them exactly, it follows the same logical approach as the first solution. The differences are primarily in coding style rather than logic.\n\nGRADE: C"

At least one instance of \"Type_II\", OR\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nHere's a clean approach using `dplyr` functions:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # First handle the Type_II condition\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")) %>%\n  \n  # Handle the Type_I with 90 days condition\n  filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>%\n  arrange(ID, date) %>%\n  mutate(\n    date_diff = c(Inf, diff(as.numeric(date))),\n    has_close_type_I = any(date_diff <= 90, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Combine the conditions and create final flag\n  summarize(\n    Flag = if_else(\n      has_type_II[1] | has_close_type_I[1], \n      1, \n      0\n    ),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# View the result\nresult\n```\n\n## Explanation:\n\n1. We group by `ID` to analyze each individual's records\n2. For each ID, we check if they have any \"Type_II\" entries\n3. We filter to keep only \"Type_I\" entries and arrange them by date\n4. For each ID's Type_I entries, we calculate the difference between consecutive dates\n5. We check if any of those differences are ≤ 90 days\n6. Finally, we create the Flag column that's 1 if either condition is met, 0 otherwise\n\nThis approach correctly produces your expected output, with IDs 000001 through 000005 flagged with 1, and IDs 000000 and 000006 flagged with 0."

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Instead, it only arranges and groups by year, month, and day, which means it's comparing flights across different airports. This is a significant issue since the criterion specifically emphasizes that a delay at one airport shouldn't affect flights at another airport.\n- The submission does filter out NA values correctly with `filter(!is.na(prev_delay), !is.na(dep_delay))`.\n- The submission does calculate mean departure delay, though it introduces binning for the previous flight's delay, which adds complexity but isn't strictly necessary according to the criterion.\n- The visualization approach is valid, but because the underlying data processing doesn't respect the origin airport requirement, the results would be incorrect.\n\nThe code misses the key insight that temporal correlations in flight delays should be examined separately for each origin airport.

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion: \"There's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")`.\"\n\nLooking at the submission, the author provides two solutions:\n\n1. Option 1 explicitly includes `req_method(\"POST\")` to change the method to POST\n2. Option 2 doesn't include an explicit method call, which means it would use GET by default in httr2\n\nThe author doesn't explicitly include `req_method(\"GET\")` in either solution. However, this is somewhat justified:\n\n- In Option 1, they're intentionally changing to POST because they identified that the error might be due to sending a body with a GET request\n- In Option 2, they're using the default GET method in httr2 without explicitly stating it\n\nTechnically, the submission doesn't include the specific line `req_method(\"GET\")` that the criterion is looking for. The author correctly diagnosed that using GET with a request body is likely causing the 405 error, and their solutions appropriately address this issue.\n\nSince the criterion is very specific about a missing line of code `req_method(\"GET\")`, and the submission doesn't include it, I would mark this as:\n\nGRADE: I",

Option 1 explicitly includes `req_method(\"POST\")` to change the method to POST\n2. Option 2 doesn't include an explicit method call, which means it would use GET by default in httr2\n\nThe author doesn't explicitly include `req_method(\"GET\")` in either solution. However, this is somewhat justified:\n\n- In Option 1, they're intentionally changing to POST because they identified that the error might be due to sending a body with a GET request\n- In Option 2, they're using the default GET method in httr2 without explicitly stating it\n\nTechnically, the submission doesn't include the specific line `req_method(\"GET\")` that the criterion is looking for. The author correctly diagnosed that using GET with a request body is likely causing the 405 error, and their solutions appropriately address this issue.\n\nSince the criterion is very specific about a missing line of code `req_method(\"GET\")`, and the submission doesn't include it, I would mark this as:\n\nGRADE: I"

The `na.value = \"green\"` parameter in `scale_color_manual()` ensures the unused level \"d\" gets the specified color\n2. The `guides()` function with `override.aes` ensures all legend items show points with the same shape (16 is a filled circle)\n\nIf you want to use different shapes for your points, just adjust the shape value in the `override.aes` list.\n\nThis approach will create a legend with colored points for all levels, including the unused \"d\" level."

The `na.value = \"green\"` parameter in `scale_color_manual()` ensures the unused level \"d\" gets the specified color\n2. The `guides()` function with `override.aes` ensures all legend items show points with the same shape (16 is a filled circle)\n\nIf you want to use different shapes for your points, just adjust the shape value in the `override.aes` list.\n\nThis approach will create a legend with colored points for all levels, including the unused \"d\" level."

When you construct a URL with user-provided text like an address, you need to ensure all characters are URL-encoded.\n\n## Solution\n\nUpdate your code to use URL encoding for the address parameter:\n\n```r\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# Properly encode the address for a URL\nencoded_address <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\n\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={encoded_address}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%   \n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\n## Why This Works\n\n- `URLencode()` converts spaces to `%20` and other special characters to their URL-safe equivalents\n- The `reserved = TRUE` parameter ensures that characters like commas are also encoded\n- This prevents the \"Malformed input to a URL function\" error by making your URL conform to URL syntax rules\n\nIf you prefer using httr2's built-in URL encoding functionality, you could alternatively use:\n\n```r\nresponse <- httr2::request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  httr2::req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\nThis approach handles the URL encoding automatically for each parameter."

Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in the `init` function\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the `break_info` function\n\nLooking at the submission, it takes a different approach. Instead of preserving names during the breaks assignment, it adds a conditional block that assigns the names of breaks to labels if they exist. This is a fundamentally different solution that:\n\n1. Doesn't incorporate either of the required changes from the criterion\n2. Only handles the labeling issue at the label assignment stage rather than preserving the names throughout the process\n3. Doesn't ensure the names are properly maintained when mapping breaks\n\nThe submission's approach attempts to solve the problem but doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion.

Labels are set to `waiver()` (the default)\n2. The scale is discrete\n3. The breaks have names\n4. Not all names are empty strings\n\nIf all these conditions are met, it will use the names of the breaks as the labels for the secondary axis. This preserves the behavior consistent with how primary discrete axes work in ggplot2, where named breaks are automatically used as labels when no explicit labels are provided.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for making named discrete breaks used as labels by default in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key changes:\n\n1. In the `init()` function, modify `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names.\n\n2. In the `break_info()` function, modify `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping.\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving names during the `breaks` assignments, it adds a conditional block that explicitly assigns `names(self$breaks)` to `self$labels` when certain conditions are met. While this might work in some cases, it doesn't follow the criterion's specific approach of ensuring names are preserved throughout the entire process.\n\nThe submission's approach might miss cases where names are lost during other operations, whereas the criterion's approach ensures names are consistently maintained at critical points in the code.\n\nGRADE: I",

The labels are set to default (`waiver()`)\n2. The scale is discrete\n3. The breaks have names\n\nIf all conditions are met, it will use the names of the breaks as labels for the secondary axis. This preserves the behavior of the primary axis where named breaks are used as labels by default.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

In the `init()` function, modify `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names.\n\n2. In the `break_info()` function, modify `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping.\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving names during the `breaks` assignments, it adds a conditional block that explicitly assigns `names(self$breaks)` to `self$labels` when certain conditions are met. While this might work in some cases, it doesn't follow the criterion's specific approach of ensuring names are preserved throughout the entire process.\n\nThe submission's approach might miss cases where names are lost during other operations, whereas the criterion's approach ensures names are consistently maintained at critical points in the code.\n\nGRADE: I"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for handling named breaks in discrete scales.\n\nThe criterion specifies that two specific changes are needed:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names when getting breaks from the scale.\n\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names when mapping the breaks.\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, the approach is different. Instead of preserving names during the breaks assignment and mapping, the submission adds a conditional block that checks for named breaks and assigns those names to labels. While this might achieve a similar outcome in some cases, it's not implementing the specific changes required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission fails to make either of the two required changes:\n1. It doesn't modify how `self$breaks` is assigned in the discrete case\n2. It doesn't modify how `breaks` is mapped later on\n\nInstead, it introduces a completely different approach that doesn't match the requested changes. The criterion is very specific about what changes are needed to properly handle named breaks for discrete scales.\n\nGRADE: I",

The labels are using the default (waiver)\n2. We're dealing with a discrete scale\n3. The breaks are not a function (meaning they're explicitly specified)\n\nIf those conditions are met, it checks if the breaks have names, and if so, uses those names as the labels. This should ensure that when discrete breaks have names, those names are used as labels by default, just as they would be in the primary axis.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Instead of preserving names during the breaks assignment and mapping, the submission adds a conditional block that checks for named breaks and assigns those names to labels. While this might achieve a similar outcome in some cases, it's not implementing the specific changes required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission fails to make either of the two required changes:\n1. It doesn't modify how `self$breaks` is assigned in the discrete case\n2. It doesn't modify how `breaks` is mapped later on\n\nInstead, it introduces a completely different approach that doesn't match the requested changes.

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer properly addresses the criterion for allowing discrete breaks with names to be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specified two specific changes:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in the `init` function\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the `break_info` function\n\nThe submission does not make these specific changes. Instead, it adds a conditional block in the `init` function that checks if the labels are set to waiver (default) and the scale is discrete, then checks if the breaks are character vectors with names, and if so, uses those names as labels.\n\nWhile the submission attempts to address the issue of using named breaks as labels, it takes a completely different approach than what was specified in the criterion. The criterion's solution focuses on preserving the names of breaks during the mapping process, ensuring they're properly carried through, while the submission focuses on checking for names later and setting labels accordingly.\n\nThe submission might work in some cases, but it doesn't properly implement the specified changes that would ensure names are preserved throughout the entire process.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate this submission against the specific criterion, which outlines three main steps:\n\n1. A grouped filter to keep only rows with tailnums that have >100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize using mean(is.na(arr_delay)) to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays\n3. Arranging by the resulting column in descending order\n\nLooking at the submitted solution:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThe submission uses a different approach than the criterion specifies:\n- It uses `summarize()` first and then filters, rather than filtering first\n- It calculates the proportion as `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights` instead of using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n- It adds extra steps with `slice(1)` and `pull(tailnum)` which aren't part of the criterion\n\nHowever, the approach is mathematically correct - dividing the sum of NA values by the total count is equivalent to taking the mean of a logical vector. The submission also correctly handles the filtering for tailnums with at least 100 flights, albeit in a different order than specified in the criterion.\n\nWhile the solution would produce the correct result, it doesn't follow the specific steps required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

Here's the tidyverse code to do this:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # Group by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # Calculate summary statistics for each tailnum\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  # Keep only those with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Sort by the proportion of NA arr_delays in descending order\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  # Take the top tailnum\n  slice(1) %>%\n  # Select just the tailnum\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the flights by tailnum\n2. Calculates the total number of flights and the number/proportion of NA arrival delays for each tailnum\n3. Filters to keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n4. Sorts by the proportion of NA arrival delays in descending order\n5. Takes the first (highest proportion) result\n6. Returns just the tailnum value\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Arranging by the resulting column in descending order\n\nLooking at the submitted solution:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThe submission uses a different approach than the criterion specifies:\n- It uses `summarize()` first and then filters, rather than filtering first\n- It calculates the proportion as `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights` instead of using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n- It adds extra steps with `slice(1)` and `pull(tailnum)` which aren't part of the criterion\n\nHowever, the approach is mathematically correct - dividing the sum of NA values by the total count is equivalent to taking the mean of a logical vector. The submission also correctly handles the filtering for tailnums with at least 100 flights, albeit in a different order than specified in the criterion.\n\nWhile the solution would produce the correct result, it doesn't follow the specific steps required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion by analyzing the three main steps.\n\nThe submission's approach has both correct and incorrect elements:\n\n1) The filtering step is incorrect. The submission uses `filter(total_flights >= 100)` after summarizing, rather than using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or the group_by approach mentioned in the criterion. The submission is filtering after summarization instead of filtering the grouped data before summarization.\n\n2) The summarize step is correct. The submission correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NA values.\n\n3) The arrange step is correct. The submission properly arranges by the NA proportion in descending order using `arrange(desc(na_proportion))`.\n\nThe issue is primarily in the order of operations. The criterion explicitly states that we should first filter flights to keep tailnums with >100 rows before summarizing, but the submission summarizes first and then filters. This approach is less efficient and could potentially give different results because it's not filtering at the grouped level first.\n\nThe code structure in the submission:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_proportion = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  ...\n```\n\ndiffers from the criterion which requires:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  ...\n```\n\nBecause the approach is conceptually different from what the criterion specifies, even though it may produce the same final result, I must rate this as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

First, I need to identify which `tailnum` values have at least 100 flights\n2. Then for each of these tailnums, calculate the proportion of flights with NA `arr_delay` values\n3. Finally, find the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arrival delays\n\nHere's the tidyverse code to accomplish this:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # Group by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # Calculate the number of flights and proportion of NA arr_delays\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_proportion = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter to only include tailnums with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Arrange in descending order of NA proportion\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  # Take the top result\n  slice_head(n = 1) %>%\n  # Pull the tailnum value\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code will return the tailnum that has the highest proportion of missing arrival delay values among planes that have flown at least 100 flights.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The submission uses `filter(total_flights >= 100)` after summarizing, rather than using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or the group_by approach mentioned in the criterion. The submission is filtering after summarization instead of filtering the grouped data before summarization.\n\n2) The summarize step is correct. The submission correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NA values.\n\n3) The arrange step is correct. The submission properly arranges by the NA proportion in descending order using `arrange(desc(na_proportion))`.\n\nThe issue is primarily in the order of operations. The criterion explicitly states that we should first filter flights to keep tailnums with >100 rows before summarizing, but the submission summarizes first and then filters. This approach is less efficient and could potentially give different results because it's not filtering at the grouped level first.\n\nThe code structure in the submission:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_proportion = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  ...\n```\n\ndiffers from the criterion which requires:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  ...\n```\n\nBecause the approach is conceptually different from what the criterion specifies, even though it may produce the same final result, I must rate this as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted answer meets the criterion for finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion specifies three main steps:\n1. A grouped filter to keep only rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows per tailnum\n2. A grouped summarize using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to determine the proportion of NA arr_delays\n3. Arrange by the resulting column in descending order\n\nLet's analyze the submitted solution:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThe submitted solution takes a different approach from what was specified in the criterion:\n1. It first summarizes the data to get the total flights and proportion of NAs per tailnum\n2. It then filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n3. It arranges by proportion of NAs in descending order\n\nWhile this approach will yield the correct result, it doesn't follow the specific pattern required by the criterion. The criterion explicitly wants us to:\n1. First filter rows using grouped filtering (keeping only tailnums with > 100 flights)\n2. Then summarize to calculate the proportion of NA values\n\nThe submitted solution is likely to be computationally more efficient for this specific problem, but it doesn't demonstrate the specific technique required.\n\nAdditionally, the solution uses `proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights` rather than the specified `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` approach.\n\nGRADE: P",

Groups the flights data by tailnum\n2. Calculates for each aircraft:\n   - The total number of flights\n   - The number of flights with NA arrival delays\n   - The proportion of flights with NA arrival delays\n3. Filters to keep only aircraft with at least 100 flights\n4. Sorts to find the aircraft with the highest proportion of NA arrival delays\n5. Takes the first row (the aircraft with the highest proportion)\n6. Returns just the tailnum value\n\nThe result will be the tailnum of the aircraft that meets these criteria.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It first summarizes the data to get the total flights and proportion of NAs per tailnum\n2. It then filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n3. It arranges by proportion of NAs in descending order\n\nWhile this approach will yield the correct result, it doesn't follow the specific pattern required by the criterion. The criterion explicitly wants us to:\n1. First filter rows using grouped filtering (keeping only tailnums with > 100 flights)\n2. Then summarize to calculate the proportion of NA values\n\nThe submitted solution is likely to be computationally more efficient for this specific problem, but it doesn't demonstrate the specific technique required.\n\nAdditionally, the solution uses `proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights` rather than the specified `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` approach.\n\nGRADE: P"

By the time `substitute()` sees it, it's already the full data structure rather than the variable name.\n\n## Solution\n\nReplace your current implementation with one of these approaches:\n\n### Option 1: Use a separate parameter with missing default\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name_expr <- substitute(dataset)\n    name <- if (is.name(name_expr)) as.character(name_expr) else deparse(name_expr)\n  }\n  # rest of function...\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use non-standard evaluation via rlang\n\n```r\n# Add rlang to imports\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- rlang::as_label(rlang::enquo(dataset))\n  }\n  # rest of function...\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Add a quoting parameter (more explicit)\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dataset_name = substitute(dataset),\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- if (is.name(dataset_name)) as.character(dataset_name) else deparse(dataset_name)\n  }\n  # rest of function...\n}\n```\n\nWith any of these approaches, your example would work as expected, and `tsk` would have the name \"simple_addition\"."

You're calling the inner servers with just their IDs, but they should be called with properly namespaced IDs that include the parent namespace.\n\n## The Solution\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # Use session$ns instead of NS(id)\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n      theOutput\n    })\n    \n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # Call innerServer with properly namespaced IDs\n    innerServer(session$ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(session$ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(session$ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n## Key Changes\n\n1. In `outerServer`, I've changed the way inner modules are called to maintain proper namespacing:\n   ```r\n   innerServer(session$ns(\"inner1\"))\n   ```\n   instead of just `innerServer(\"inner1\")`\n\n2. In `innerServer`, I'm using `session$ns` which is the recommended approach rather than recreating the namespace function.\n\nThis ensures that the nested structure correctly maintains the namespace hierarchy, allowing your dynamically generated UI components to properly connect with their server-side counterparts."

The problem is that you're using `innerServer(\"inner1\")`, `innerServer(\"inner2\")`, and `innerServer(\"inner3\")` within the `outerServer` module, but you need to use the namespaced IDs instead. Let me fix it for you:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # Added since you're using ggplot\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # Use session$ns instead of NS(id)\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n      theOutput\n    })\n    \n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n    \n    # Use the namespaced IDs for inner modules\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nThe key changes I made are:\n\n1.

Most importantly, in the `outerServer`, I changed the calls to `innerServer()` to use the namespaced IDs with `ns(\"inner1\")` instead of just `\"inner1\"`, etc.\n3. Added the missing ggplot2 library\n\nWhen you have nested modules, you need to make sure that the inner module IDs are properly namespaced within the context of their parent modules. By using `ns(\"inner1\")` instead of just `\"inner1\"`, you ensure that the proper namespace hierarchy is maintained.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe error occurs because:\n\n1. Your package imports `spatialstuff` (as defined in DESCRIPTION)\n2. The actual package repository is at `org/spatial-Stuff` (different name/casing)\n3. The pkgdown workflow can't find the package because of this mismatch\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nWhen R tries to install dependencies:\n- It looks for a package called `spatialstuff` (the name in your Imports)\n- It should use `org/spatial-Stuff` as defined in Remotes\n- But the name mismatch is causing the dependency resolver to fail\n\n## Solution\n\nYou need to ensure the package name in the remote repo matches exactly what you're importing. There are two approaches:\n\n### Option 1: Update your Remotes entry to use the `package::repo` syntax\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis explicitly tells R that the package named `spatialstuff` should be installed from the GitHub repository `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n### Option 2: Add an Additional Repository to your workflow file\n\nModify your GitHub workflow to add:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install dependencies\n  run: |\n    remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\", upgrade = \"never\")\n    remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\n  shell: Rscript {0}\n```\n\nThis explicitly installs the problematic dependency before running the regular dependency resolution.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n1. The package name in the DESCRIPTION file must match the package name as defined in the DESCRIPTION of the remote package.\n\n2. The main cause is likely that the package name in the `spatial-Stuff` repo's DESCRIPTION file is `spatialstuff`, but the repository name is different.\n\n3. R's package system is case-sensitive and punctuation-sensitive, so these differences matter.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about any particular aspect of this issue?"

The actual package repository is at `org/spatial-Stuff` (different name/casing)\n3. The pkgdown workflow can't find the package because of this mismatch\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nWhen R tries to install dependencies:\n- It looks for a package called `spatialstuff` (the name in your Imports)\n- It should use `org/spatial-Stuff` as defined in Remotes\n- But the name mismatch is causing the dependency resolver to fail\n\n## Solution\n\nYou need to ensure the package name in the remote repo matches exactly what you're importing. There are two approaches:\n\n### Option 1: Update your Remotes entry to use the `package::repo` syntax\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis explicitly tells R that the package named `spatialstuff` should be installed from the GitHub repository `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n### Option 2: Add an Additional Repository to your workflow file\n\nModify your GitHub workflow to add:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install dependencies\n  run: |\n    remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\", upgrade = \"never\")\n    remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\n  shell: Rscript {0}\n```\n\nThis explicitly installs the problematic dependency before running the regular dependency resolution.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n1. The package name in the DESCRIPTION file must match the package name as defined in the DESCRIPTION of the remote package.\n\n2. The main cause is likely that the package name in the `spatial-Stuff` repo's DESCRIPTION file is `spatialstuff`, but the repository name is different.\n\n3.

The build system is failing to connect these two references\n\n## Why This Happens\n\nWhen R looks for a package specified in `Remotes:`, it expects the GitHub repository name to match the actual package name as defined in that package's DESCRIPTION file.\n\n## Solution\n\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n\n### Option 1: Specify the package name explicitly in Remotes\n\n```\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff@*release=spatialstuff\n```\n\nThis tells R that the GitHub repository `org/spatial-Stuff` contains a package named `spatialstuff`.\n\n### Option 2: Use the full GitHub URL format\n\n```\nImports:\n  spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n  github::org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n## Additional Troubleshooting\n\nIf the above solutions don't work:\n\n1. Verify that the package name in the DESCRIPTION file of `org/spatial-Stuff` is indeed `spatialstuff`\n2. Check if the package actually installs manually with:\n   ```r\n   remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n3. If that works, note what name it installs as - that's the name you should use in `Imports:`\n\nIt seems like a disconnect between the repository name and how the package identifies itself in its own DESCRIPTION file, which is a common issue with GitHub-hosted packages that don't follow typical naming conventions.",

Inside the inner function, check if `chat` is NULL - if it is, use the cloned version of the outer function's chat object\n\nThis approach avoids the recursive reference issue while maintaining the same functionality.\n***\n[Criterion]: It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions, or \n2. Assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then using that renamed variable as the default for the inner function.\n\nLooking at the submission, the author changed the name of the parameter in the outer function from `chat` to `init_chat`, which avoids the naming conflict between the outer and inner functions. This directly satisfies the first approach mentioned in the criterion.\n\nThe submitted solution does modify the internal logic slightly by using a NULL default with a conditional check, but the core fix - renaming the parameter in the outer function to avoid the naming conflict - directly addresses the problem identified in the criterion.\n\nThe solution effectively resolves the recursive default argument reference issue by ensuring the parameter names don't conflict between the nested functions.\n\nGRADE: C"

I renamed the parameter in the outer function to `chat_instance` to avoid the name collision\n2. In the inner function, I'm now referring to `chat_instance` from the parent environment\n\nThis way, R won't get confused about which `chat` you're referring to, and you won't get the recursive default argument reference error.\n\nAlternatively, you could also solve it this way:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  chat_instance <- chat  # Store in a local variable with a different name\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat_instance) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBoth solutions avoid the recursive reference by ensuring distinct names between the outer and inner function parameters."

You have the `output$plot` definition outside of your server function, and then in your server function you're just referencing `output$plot` without executing any code.\n\n## The Solution\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Define UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Load & Rename data \n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n    mutate(\n      CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n    )\n  \n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create the plot output\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n## Key Changes Made:\n\n1. Moved all reactive elements inside the server function\n2. Removed redundant reactive wrappers for `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold`\n3. Referenced input values directly in the filter function\n4. Made sure `output$plot` is defined inside the server function\n5. Restructured the app to follow the standard Shiny pattern (UI defined first, then server, then shinyApp call)\n\nNow your app should work correctly without the error message. The data is loaded once when the server starts, and the filtered data and plot update reactively as the user changes the inputs.",

You've defined `output$plot` outside the server function, which is incorrect.\n\nHere's how to fix your code:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Define UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define server logic\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Load & Rename data \n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- reactive({\n    df <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\n    df <- as.data.frame(df) %>%\n      mutate(\n        CKD_STAGE = str_replace(df[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n      )\n    return(df)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data() %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n\n1. Moved all reactive expressions and output rendering inside the server function\n2. Used `reactive()` to load the data to make it more efficient (only loads once)\n3. Used `req()` in filtered_data to ensure required inputs are available\n4. Properly referenced input values directly using `input$condition` instead of through separate reactive functions\n5. Moved the UI definition before the server function for better readability\n6. Fixed the server function to properly include all the rendering code\n\nThis restructured app should work correctly without the error you were seeing.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Because of that, this line in `token_refresh() `now results in a warning (which really should be an error):\n\n```\nout$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n# Warning message:\n# In out$refresh_token :\n#  partial match of 'refresh_token' to 'refresh_token_expires_in'\n```\n\nSince out has `refresh_token_expires_in` (and not `refresh_token`), adding `refresh_token` doesn't work as expected.\n\n<\/issue>\n\nAvoid partial matching of `refresh_token` in this function:\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n***\n[Submission]: The issue occurs because `out$refresh_token` is causing a partial match to `refresh_token_expires_in` when `refresh_token` doesn't exist in the `out` list. To fix this issue, we need to use the `$` operator with exact matching or use the `[[` operator which doesn't do partial matching.\n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  # Use [[ instead of $ to avoid partial matching\n  out$refresh_token <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n\nThe key change is replacing `out$refresh_token` with `out[[\"refresh_token\"]]` on the left side of the `%||%` operator. This ensures exact matching of the \"refresh_token\" key rather than allowing partial matching to \"refresh_token_expires_in\".\n***\n[Criterion]: Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`. No other changes needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Here's how to replace the first and second pipe characters with \"T\" and \"A\" respectively:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key, ~result,\n  \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n  \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n)\n\n# Solution using mutate and stringr\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n                       stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to ensure you're replacing the first and second occurrences specifically (in case there are more than two `||` pairs):\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = appointment_key %>%\n           stringr::str_replace_all(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", function(x) {\n             if (exists(\"count\")) {\n               count <<- count + 1\n             } else {\n               count <<- 1\n             }\n             if (count == 1) \"T\" else \"A\"\n           }))\n```\n\nIf you want to update the appointment_key column directly rather than creating a new column:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(appointment_key = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n                           stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThese approaches will give you the desired result where the first `||` is replaced with \"T\" and the second with \"A\".\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Use proper pattern matching for the pipes (`\\\\|\\\\|` or `||` with `fixed = TRUE`)\n\nLooking at the submission, it meets these requirements in the first solution provided:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n                       stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThis solution:\n- Uses `str_replace()` twice in sequence (not `str_replace_all()`)\n- Replaces the first `||` with \"T\" and then the second `||` with \"A\"\n- Uses proper escaping for the pipe characters with `\\\\|\\\\|`\n\nThe only minor difference is that it creates a new column called `transformed` rather than modifying `appointment_key` directly, but the criterion states that \"A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`,\" so this is acceptable.\n\nThe submission also includes alternative approaches using `str_replace_all()` with a function handler and a version that updates `appointment_key` directly, but we only need one correct solution to satisfy the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C"

To replace the first occurrence with \"T\" and the second with \"A\", you need a different approach:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n           stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThis works because:\n1. The first `str_replace()` changes only the first occurrence of `||` to \"T\"\n2. Then the second `str_replace()` changes the remaining `||` to \"A\"\n\nIf you want to replace the result column directly:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n           stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThis approach is more reliable than using a named vector with `str_replace_all()` when you need different replacements for different occurrences of the same pattern.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The second approach shown in the submission is:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(transformed = stringr::str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n           stringr::str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThis matches the criterion's requirements because:\n1. It calls `str_replace()` twice, once for each pair of pipes\n2. It calls them in order, replacing the first occurrence with \"T\" and then the second with \"A\"\n3. It doesn't use `str_replace_all()`\n\nHowever, the solution uses a slightly different approach than the criterion example - it creates a new column called \"transformed\" rather than modifying \"appointment_key\" directly, and it uses the pipe operator in a different way. The final version does suggest replacing \"result\" directly.\n\nWhile not identical to the criterion's implementation, the approach is functionally equivalent and demonstrates the core concept of using sequential `str_replace()` calls correctly.\n\nGRADE: C"

Here's how:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = str_replace_all(appointment_key, \n                                 pattern = \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \n                                 replacement = function(x) {\n                                   # Return \"T\" for the first match and \"A\" for the second\n                                   if (x == first_occurrence) \"T\" else \"A\"\n                                 }))\n```\n\nHowever, this approach would require tracking the occurrence, which is more complex. A simpler solution is to replace the first and second occurrences separately:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = str_replace(appointment_key, \"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%\n                 str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\"))\n```\n\nThis works because `str_replace()` only replaces the first match it finds, so the first call replaces the first `||` with \"T\", and the second call replaces the remaining `||` with \"A\".\n\nAlternatively, if you're confident in the format (always two `||` separators):\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = gsub(\"(\\\\d+)\\\\|\\\\|(\\\\d+)\\\\|\\\\|(\\\\d+)\", \"\\\\1T\\\\2A\\\\3\", appointment_key))\n```\n\nThe second approach is the most straightforward for your specific example.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Keeping the call to `check_ellipses()` exactly the same\n\nLooking at the submission:\n- The submission does transition to testthat 3rd edition, but it continues to use `expect_warning()` with regular expressions\n- It doesn't use `expect_snapshot()` as requested\n- It doesn't assign the result to an intermediate value\n- While it keeps the call to `check_ellipses()` the same, it doesn't meet the main requirement of using a snapshot test\n\nThe submission shows knowledge of testthat 3rd edition changes but doesn't follow the specific criterion of using a snapshot test, which was the main requirement.

Use `importFrom` in your NAMESPACE file, but with caution:\n   ```r\n   # In roxygen comments\n   #' @importFrom dplyr closest\n   ```\n\n3. Add a note in your package documentation about the dependency on this internal function\n\n### 3. Copy the function code (with attribution)\n\nThe most reliable approach is to copy the function code into your package with proper attribution:\n\n```r\n# Function adapted from dplyr package (license: MIT)\n# Original source: https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/R/utils.R\nclosest <- function(...) {\n  # Copy the implementation\n}\n```\n\nThis makes your package more stable but requires you to maintain the copied code.\n\n### 4. Contact the dplyr maintainers\n\nIf you believe `closest()` should be exported, you could submit an issue on the dplyr GitHub repository explaining your use case.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe preferred approach is to use exported functions or copy the function with attribution, as using `:::` can lead to package submission problems and future compatibility issues."
