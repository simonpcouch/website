A more detailed approach that flags individual records and then summarizes by ID\n\nThe submitted answer follows a similar approach to the first method in the criterion:\n- It groups by ID\n- It checks for \"Type_II\" with `has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- It determines if Type_I records occur within 90 days of each other by sorting dates and using `diff()`\n- It combines these conditions with OR and converts to an integer flag\n\nThe submission is essentially implementing the same logic as the criterion solution, just with slightly different naming and intermediate variables. The core approach and logic are correct. The submission correctly handles both criteria and combines them with OR logic to determine the final flag.\n\nGRADE: C",

A more detailed approach that flags individual records and then summarizes by ID\n\nThe submitted answer follows a similar approach to the first method in the criterion:\n- It groups by ID\n- It checks for \"Type_II\" with `has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- It determines if Type_I records occur within 90 days of each other by sorting dates and using `diff()`\n- It combines these conditions with OR and converts to an integer flag\n\nThe submission is essentially implementing the same logic as the criterion solution, just with slightly different naming and intermediate variables. The core approach and logic are correct. The submission correctly handles both criteria and combines them with OR logic to determine the final flag.\n\nGRADE: C"

A more detailed approach that flags individual records and then summarizes by ID\n\nThe submitted answer follows a similar approach to the first method in the criterion:\n- It groups by ID\n- It checks for \"Type_II\" with `has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- It determines if Type_I records occur within 90 days of each other by sorting dates and using `diff()`\n- It combines these conditions with OR and converts to an integer flag\n\nThe submission is essentially implementing the same logic as the criterion solution, just with slightly different naming and intermediate variables. The core approach and logic are correct. The submission correctly handles both criteria and combines them with OR logic to determine the final flag.\n\nGRADE: C"

The approach is well-structured and follows tidyverse principles.\n\nThe criterion provides two possible solutions, and while the submission doesn't match either exactly, it uses the same fundamental logic and tidyverse approach. The submission actually provides detailed explanations of how each part works, which is helpful.\n\nThe only minor difference is in implementation details - the first criterion solution is more concise, but the submitted answer is equally correct and possibly more readable with its step-by-step approach.\n\nGRADE: C",

Otherwise, diff(i_dates) computes consecutive date differences; any(diff(i_dates) <= 90) checks whether any pair is within 90 days of one another.  \n• The final flag is 1 if either has_typeII or has_close_typeI is TRUE, otherwise 0.\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne could also `mutate()` to summarise per record for each ID, then `summarise()` to see if any record per ID meets either one of the criteria:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  arrange(ID, date, visit) |> \n  # work out individual flags\n  mutate(\n    # flag type_ii records\n    flag_t2 = case_match(type, 'Type_II' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag type_i records\n    flag_t1 = case_match(type, 'Type_I' ~ T, .default = F),\n    # flag records within 90 days of previous one\n    flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90,\n    # calculate overall flag for record\n    Flag = case_when(\n      flag_t2 ~ T,\n      flag_t1 & flag_90d ~ T,\n      .default = F\n    ),\n    .by = ID\n  ) |> \n  # summarise per ID\n  summarise(\n    Flag = max(Flag),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Groups the data by ID using `group_by(ID)`\n2. Creates two logical indicators:\n   - `has_typeII` checks if any records are \"Type_II\"\n   - `has_close_typeI` checks for Type_I dates within 90 days of each other by sorting dates, calculating differences, and checking if any are ≤ 90 days\n3. Combines these two conditions with OR (|) to create the final flag\n4. Returns a dataframe with ID and Flag columns\n\nThe solution correctly handles both criteria and produces the expected output. The approach is well-structured and follows tidyverse principles.\n\nThe criterion provides two possible solutions, and while the submission doesn't match either exactly, it uses the same fundamental logic and tidyverse approach. The submission actually provides detailed explanations of how each part works, which is helpful.\n\nThe only minor difference is in implementation details - the first criterion solution is more concise, but the submitted answer is equally correct and possibly more readable with its step-by-step approach.\n\nGRADE: C"

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` (airport), since delays at one airport don't affect flights at other airports\n2. The mean departure delay should be calculated for each value of the lagged departure delay\n\nLooking at the submitted answer:\n\n- It arranges flights by time order (year, month, day, dep_time) but doesn't group by `origin` when creating the lagged values. This means it's treating all airports as one continuous sequence, which doesn't match the reality of how delays propagate.\n\n- It does correctly remove NA values with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay))` at the beginning.\n\n- It correctly calculates the mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay value.\n\n- It produces an appropriate visualization showing the relationship between previous delay and current delay.\n\nThe main issue is that the submission does not account for the fact that delays should be airport-specific, which is a fundamental conceptual error in the approach. While the code will run and produce a plot, it won't correctly represent the temporal correlation of delays within the same airport as required.\n\nGRADE: P",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Below is one approach. The key idea is to sort the data in time order so that lag(dep_delay) refers to the departure delay of the preceding flight in chronological order. Then group by that lagged value and compute the mean departure delay for the “next” flight.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_summary <- flights %>%\n  # Remove rows with missing departure delay\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Sort in ascending chronological order\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Create a new column with the departure delay of the *previous* flight\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # For each unique previous delay, compute the mean of the *new* flight’s departure delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Plot the relationship\nggplot(flights_summary, aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay of next flight (minutes)\"\n  )\n\nNote: Sometimes you may want to restrict your analysis (for instance, remove extremely large delays) so the trend is clearer. Also, one might consider “previous flight” specifically for the same airplane (i.e., same tailnum), in which case you would group_by(tailnum) before arranging and lagging.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` (airport), since delays at one airport don't affect flights at other airports\n2. The mean departure delay should be calculated for each value of the lagged departure delay\n\nLooking at the submitted answer:\n\n- It arranges flights by time order (year, month, day, dep_time) but doesn't group by `origin` when creating the lagged values. This means it's treating all airports as one continuous sequence, which doesn't match the reality of how delays propagate.\n\n- It does correctly remove NA values with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay))` at the beginning.\n\n- It correctly calculates the mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay value.\n\n- It produces an appropriate visualization showing the relationship between previous delay and current delay.\n\nThe main issue is that the submission does not account for the fact that delays should be airport-specific, which is a fundamental conceptual error in the approach. While the code will run and produce a plot, it won't correctly represent the temporal correlation of delays within the same airport as required.\n\nGRADE: P"

The key idea is:\n\n1. Group by the airplane (tailnum) so that we only lag over flights operated by the same aircraft.  \n2. Arrange flights in chronological order within each tailnum.  \n3. Use lag(dep_delay) so that each flight has the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight.  \n4. Finally, group by that prior flight's delay and compute the mean delay of the current flight before plotting.\n\nExample code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Keep only flights with a non-missing departure delay.\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by airplane so we track the same aircraft from flight to flight.\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # Sort chronologically so lag() makes sense.\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  # Attach the previous flight's delay as a new column.\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # Group by the previous flight's delay...\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  # ...and find the mean current flight delay for each unique previous delay.\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # Plot mean departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay.\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n      y = \"Mean Current Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\"\n    )\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The mean departure delay should be calculated by grouping on the numeric lagged departure delay\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nThe code groups by `tailnum` (the airplane) instead of `origin` (the airport). This is a significant issue because the criterion specifically states that \"the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport\" - delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at another airport.\n\nThe submission does properly:\n- Filter out non-missing departure delays\n- Arrange chronologically (though by tailnum instead of origin)\n- Create the lagged departure delay\n- Remove NAs (using na.rm=TRUE in the mean calculation)\n- Group by the previous flight's delay to calculate the mean departure delay\n- Create an appropriate visualization\n\nHowever, the fundamental grouping error (using tailnum instead of origin) means that the analysis doesn't correctly address the temporal correlation of delays at the same airport, which is the core of the question.\n\nGRADE: P"

My code is as follows:\n\n```\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%   \n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\nHowever, this does not work.

You can fix this by passing the address as a properly encoded query parameter, rather than gluing it directly into the URL. For example, with httr2 you can do:\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\nres <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\nThis approach automatically encodes any commas, spaces, etc. If you really must construct the URL string yourself, then encode address:\n\naddress_encoded <- utils::URLencode(\"Prince st., New York 10012\")\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address_encoded}\")\n\nAdditionally, note that geocode.maps.co does not require (or accept) an API key, so you can omit any &api_key=... parameter.\n***\n[Criterion]: Format the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and, likely, removing punctuation. Something like:\n\n```\naddress <- \"Prince+st+New+York+10012\"\n```\n\nIt would also be correct to pass the URL with the existing `address` to `URLencode()` or `url_encode()`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Right now, your raw address string (including spaces, commas, etc.) is causing the URL to be malformed. There are two main ways to fix this:\n\n1) Manually URL-encode the address.  \n2) Use httr2’s built-in function for adding query parameters, which automatically handles URL-encoding.\n\nFor example, you can change your code to:\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\nresponse <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address) %>%  # Automatically URL-encodes the address\n  req_perform()\n\nBecause geocode.maps.co doesn’t actually require an API key, you can omit it. If you did need to pass an api_key parameter, you could simply do:\n\nresponse <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    q = address,\n    api_key = my_secret_api_key  # hypothetical parameter\n  ) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\nIn either case, the key is to avoid directly pasting a string with spaces and special characters onto a URL without properly encoding it.\n***\n[Criterion]: Format the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and, likely, removing punctuation. Something like:\n\n```\naddress <- \"Prince+st+New+York+10012\"\n```\n\nIt would also be correct to pass the URL with the existing `address` to `URLencode()` or `url_encode()`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted answer incorporates the specific changes mentioned in the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two clear and specific code changes:\n1. Modify `if (scale$is_discrete()) { self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks() }` to use `setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Modify the `else { breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks) }` section to use `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, the approach is different. Instead of making these direct modifications:\n- It adds a larger block of code after the existing label-handling logic\n- It implements a more complex approach that checks if breaks is a named vector, and if so, moves those names to labels\n- It then strips names from breaks using `unname()`\n\nWhile the submission attempts to address the issue of using named discrete breaks for labels, it does not implement the specific code changes requested in the criterion. The approach is more complex and operates differently than the simple `setNames()` calls specified.\n\nGRADE: I",

After that, strip the breaks'\n  # names so that the breaks themselves remain the un-named values (which\n  # the discrete scale expects for matching), while self$labels get the\n  # (former) names.\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    if (!is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n      # Only override labels if the user did not already set them.\n      # (Whether or not they used derive() is already addressed above.)\n      if (is.waiver(self$labels)) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      }\n      # Remove the names from the breaks themselves.\n      self$breaks <- unname(self$breaks)\n    }\n  }\n\n  # If guide = derive(), copy over the primary axis guide\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of the changes:\n\n• We modify init() because it is already responsible for inheriting settings from the primary scale.  \n• After handling is.derived(self$labels), we check whether scale$is_discrete().  \n• If discrete, we look to see if self$breaks is a named vector (*.  \n• If self$labels was never set (still is.waiver), we set self$labels to the names of self$breaks.  \n• Finally, we remove those names from self$breaks itself via unname(), so that discrete matching uses the actual (unlabeled) break values.  \n\nWith that patch, whenever you supply a named vector of discrete breaks to sec_axis (and do not manually set new labels), the secondary axis will automatically use the names from the breaks vector itself as labels.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Modify the `else { breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks) }` section to use `setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, the approach is different. Instead of making these direct modifications:\n- It adds a larger block of code after the existing label-handling logic\n- It implements a more complex approach that checks if breaks is a named vector, and if so, moves those names to labels\n- It then strips names from breaks using `unname()`\n\nWhile the submission attempts to address the issue of using named discrete breaks for labels, it does not implement the specific code changes requested in the criterion. The approach is more complex and operates differently than the simple `setNames()` calls specified.\n\nGRADE: I"

                      "text": "Below is one way to support named discrete breaks so that, by default, the names are used as labels. The key idea is to detect if the user has supplied a named vector of breaks for a discrete scale, and if so (and if the user has not manually overridden labels), automatically use those names as labels. One convenient place to do this is inside AxisSecondary's init() method, right after handling the is.derived(self$labels) case. Here is an example patch that you can add (commented) to the init() function:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n\n  # If name = derive() and scale has a name, copy over the primary axis name\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n\n  # If breaks = derive() copy over the primary axis breaks\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n\n  # If breaks are still waiver, retrieve them from the scale\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  # If labels = derive() copy over the primary axis labels\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  # NEW LOGIC FOR DISCRETE NAMED BREAKS:\n  #\n  # If this is a discrete scale, and 'breaks' is a named vector (with any\n  # non-empty names), and the user has not explicitly overridden self$labels,\n  # then use those names as labels by default.  After that, strip the breaks'\n  # names so that the breaks themselves remain the un-named values (which\n  # the discrete scale expects for matching), while self$labels get the\n  # (former) names.\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    if (!is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n      # Only override labels if the user did not already set them.\n      # (Whether or not they used derive() is already addressed above.)\n      if (is.waiver(self$labels)) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      }\n      # Remove the names from the breaks themselves.\n      self$breaks <- unname(self$breaks)\n    }\n  }\n\n  # If guide = derive(), copy over the primary axis guide\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of the changes:\n\n• We modify init() because it is already responsible for inheriting settings from the primary scale.  \n• After handling is.derived(self$labels), we check whether scale$is_discrete().  \n• If discrete, we look to see if self$breaks is a named vector (*.  \n• If self$labels was never set (still is.waiver), we set self$labels to the names of self$breaks.  \n• Finally, we remove those names from self$breaks itself via unname(), so that discrete matching uses the actual (unlabeled) break values.  \n\nWith that patch, whenever you supply a named vector of discrete breaks to sec_axis (and do not manually set new labels), the secondary axis will automatically use the names from the breaks vector itself as labels."

                  "text": "Below is one way to support named discrete breaks so that, by default, the names are used as labels. The key idea is to detect if the user has supplied a named vector of breaks for a discrete scale, and if so (and if the user has not manually overridden labels), automatically use those names as labels. One convenient place to do this is inside AxisSecondary's init() method, right after handling the is.derived(self$labels) case. Here is an example patch that you can add (commented) to the init() function:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n\n  # If name = derive() and scale has a name, copy over the primary axis name\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n\n  # If breaks = derive() copy over the primary axis breaks\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n\n  # If breaks are still waiver, retrieve them from the scale\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  # If labels = derive() copy over the primary axis labels\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  # NEW LOGIC FOR DISCRETE NAMED BREAKS:\n  #\n  # If this is a discrete scale, and 'breaks' is a named vector (with any\n  # non-empty names), and the user has not explicitly overridden self$labels,\n  # then use those names as labels by default.  After that, strip the breaks'\n  # names so that the breaks themselves remain the un-named values (which\n  # the discrete scale expects for matching), while self$labels get the\n  # (former) names.\n  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    if (!is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n      # Only override labels if the user did not already set them.\n      # (Whether or not they used derive() is already addressed above.)\n      if (is.waiver(self$labels)) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      }\n      # Remove the names from the breaks themselves.\n      self$breaks <- unname(self$breaks)\n    }\n  }\n\n  # If guide = derive(), copy over the primary axis guide\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n},\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of the changes:\n\n• We modify init() because it is already responsible for inheriting settings from the primary scale.  \n• After handling is.derived(self$labels), we check whether scale$is_discrete().  \n• If discrete, we look to see if self$breaks is a named vector (*.  \n• If self$labels was never set (still is.waiver), we set self$labels to the names of self$breaks.  \n• Finally, we remove those names from self$breaks itself via unname(), so that discrete matching uses the actual (unlabeled) break values.  \n\nWith that patch, whenever you supply a named vector of discrete breaks to sec_axis (and do not manually set new labels), the secondary axis will automatically use the names from the breaks vector itself as labels.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submitted answer meets the criterion for enabling named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default for secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes that need to be made:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submitted solution takes a different approach:\n- It adds an if statement after setting `self$breaks` for discrete scales that checks if `self$labels` is a waiver and if `self$breaks` has names\n- If both conditions are true, it sets `self$labels` to the names of `self$breaks`\n\nThis approach tries to solve the problem by directly setting the labels based on break names, rather than preserving names during the break processing as specified in the criterion.\n\nWhile the submitted solution might work for some cases, it doesn't match the specific implementation required by the criterion. The criterion specifically asks for the preservation of names during break processing through the `setNames()` function, which the submission doesn't use.\n\nGRADE: I",

The simplest place to hook this logic in is the “init” method of AxisSecondary, right after the code that retrieves discrete breaks. In other words, once we know the scale is discrete and we have obtained self$breaks from scale$get_breaks(), we can check whether those breaks are named and whether the user has not already specified a custom labeling scheme. If so, we default the labels to those break names. A minimal patch looks like this:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--- a/R/secondary-axes.R\n+++ b/R/secondary-axes.R\n@@ -60,6 +60,11 @@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n       self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+      # If the breaks are a named vector and the user hasn't specified other labels,\n+      # use the names of the breaks as labels\n+      if (is.waiver(self$labels) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n+        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+      }\n     } else {\n       breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n       n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of the patch:\n• Just after self$breaks is set for discrete scales, we add a check (if (is.waiver(self$labels) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) …).  \n• is.waiver(self$labels) means the user has not explicitly overridden labels.  \n• !is.null(names(self$breaks)) checks that the breaks vector is indeed named.  \n• If both conditions hold, we take the names() of the breaks to be the default labels for the secondary axis.  \n\nWith this addition, if you supply named breaks to a discrete secondary axis (and do not otherwise set labels), ggplot2 will automatically pick up those names as the labels.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

A minimal patch looks like this:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--- a/R/secondary-axes.R\n+++ b/R/secondary-axes.R\n@@ -60,6 +60,11 @@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n       self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+      # If the breaks are a named vector and the user hasn't specified other labels,\n+      # use the names of the breaks as labels\n+      if (is.waiver(self$labels) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n+        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+      }\n     } else {\n       breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n       n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExplanation of the patch:\n• Just after self$breaks is set for discrete scales, we add a check (if (is.waiver(self$labels) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) …).  \n• is.waiver(self$labels) means the user has not explicitly overridden labels.  \n• !is.null(names(self$breaks)) checks that the breaks vector is indeed named.  \n• If both conditions hold, we take the names() of the breaks to be the default labels for the secondary axis.  \n\nWith this addition, if you supply named breaks to a discrete secondary axis (and do not otherwise set labels), ggplot2 will automatically pick up those names as the labels.",

Instead of first filtering for tailnums with more than 100 flights, it counts the total flights for each tailnum and filters later.\n2. It correctly calculates the proportion of NA values in arr_delay using `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights`, which is mathematically equivalent to `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`.\n3. It arranges by the proportion in descending order, which is correct.\n4. It includes `slice(1)` to return only the top result, which is fine.\n\nThe solution is mathematically correct and will produce the intended result, but it doesn't follow the exact specified workflow in the criterion. The criterion specifically mentions filtering first with `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or `group_by(tailnum) %>% filter(n() > 100)` before summarizing.\n\nHowever, the solution is functionally equivalent and correctly calculates the proportion of NA values in arr_delay. It correctly identifies the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nGRADE: P",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly follows the three main steps described in the criterion.\n\nLet's analyze the submitted code:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n```\n\nThe criterion specifies three steps:\n1. A grouped filter to only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows\n2. A grouped summarize taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arrange by the resulting column in descending order\n\nThe submission differs from the ideal approach. Instead of filtering within the groups first (to only include `tailnum`s with > 100 flights), it:\n- Groups by `tailnum`\n- Summarizes to calculate both count and proportion of NAs\n- Then filters those results to keep only `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights\n- Arranges in descending order by the proportion\n- Uses `slice(1)` to take only the first row\n\nWhile the submission will yield the correct final result, it doesn't follow the specific approach outlined in the criterion. The criterion specifically calls for filtering within groups before summarizing, which is more efficient for large datasets as it reduces the number of rows before performing the summary calculation.\n\nAdditionally, the submission includes `slice(1)` which isn't mentioned in the criterion but doesn't affect the correctness of the answer.\n\nGRADE: P",

Arrange by the resulting column in descending order\n\nThe submission differs from the ideal approach. Instead of filtering within the groups first (to only include `tailnum`s with > 100 flights), it:\n- Groups by `tailnum`\n- Summarizes to calculate both count and proportion of NAs\n- Then filters those results to keep only `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights\n- Arranges in descending order by the proportion\n- Uses `slice(1)` to take only the first row\n\nWhile the submission will yield the correct final result, it doesn't follow the specific approach outlined in the criterion. The criterion specifically calls for filtering within groups before summarizing, which is more efficient for large datasets as it reduces the number of rows before performing the summary calculation.\n\nAdditionally, the submission includes `slice(1)` which isn't mentioned in the criterion but doesn't affect the correctness of the answer.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly finds the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe submission follows this approach:\n1. Groups by `tailnum`\n2. For each group, calculates:\n   - Total number of flights (`n = n()`)\n   - Proportion of NA values in `arr_delay` (`prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))`)\n3. Filters for tailnums with 100+ flights\n4. Arranges in descending order of the NA proportion\n5. Takes the first row (highest proportion)\n\nLet's check against the criterion:\n\n1. ✓ The code properly filters for tailnums with 100+ flights.\n2. ✓ It correctly calculates the proportion of NA values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`.\n3. ✓ It arranges by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nHowever, there's a key difference in approach:\n- The criterion suggests first filtering grouped data (using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or `group_by(tailnum) %>% filter(n() > 100)`)\n- The submission first calculates summary statistics for all tailnums, then filters (`summarize()` first, then `filter()`)\n\nBoth approaches will produce the correct result since they're mathematically equivalent in this case. The submission uses a valid alternative syntax that accomplishes the same task.\n\nThe submission correctly ignores the `planes` data as it's irrelevant to the task.\n\nGRADE: C",

The idea is:\n\n• Group by tailnum.  \n• Calculate total flights (n) and the proportion of NA arr_delay (prop_na).  \n• Filter for tailnums where there have been at least 100 flights.  \n• Arrange in descending order of prop_na.  \n• Pick the first row (slice(1)):\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n = n(),\n    prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Groups by `tailnum`\n2. For each group, calculates:\n   - Total number of flights (`n = n()`)\n   - Proportion of NA values in `arr_delay` (`prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))`)\n3. Filters for tailnums with 100+ flights\n4. Arranges in descending order of the NA proportion\n5. Takes the first row (highest proportion)\n\nLet's check against the criterion:\n\n1. ✓ The code properly filters for tailnums with 100+ flights.\n2. ✓ It correctly calculates the proportion of NA values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`.\n3. ✓ It arranges by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nHowever, there's a key difference in approach:\n- The criterion suggests first filtering grouped data (using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or `group_by(tailnum) %>% filter(n() > 100)`)\n- The submission first calculates summary statistics for all tailnums, then filters (`summarize()` first, then `filter()`)\n\nBoth approaches will produce the correct result since they're mathematically equivalent in this case. The submission uses a valid alternative syntax that accomplishes the same task.\n\nThe submission correctly ignores the `planes` data as it's irrelevant to the task.\n\nGRADE: C"

If the error persists, check that your columns really are named \"id\" and \"date\" and that you are not passing vector data instead of column names."

Instead, it focuses on the way the function is called, suggesting to use bare symbols instead of expressions\n\nWhile the submission provides useful information about how `deparse(substitute())` works, it misses the core issue that the criterion is testing - that `name` needs to be evaluated before `dataset` is used, regardless of how the function is called.\n\nThe solution should have included adding `force(name)` early in the function definition to ensure the name is captured correctly before any operations on `dataset` cause its evaluation.\n\nGRADE: I"

The real issue is that by the time `name` gets evaluated, `dataset` might have already been modified or evaluated, causing `substitute(dataset)` to return the evaluated content rather than the symbol.\n\nThe correct solution would be to force the evaluation of `name` at the beginning of the function using `force(name)`, ensuring it captures the unevaluated symbol before anything happens to `dataset`.\n\nThe submission does not mention `force(name)` or address the lazy evaluation issue at all, focusing instead on the mechanics of substitute vs match.call.\n\nGRADE: I"

Once you’re inside a moduleServer, you already have access to the correct namespace via session$ns. Simply replace:\n\nns <- NS(id)\n\nwith\n\nns <- session$ns\n\nin the server portion of your module. Here’s an updated version of innerServer:\n\ninnerServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # <-- use session$ns instead of NS(id)\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x = t.x, y = t.y)\n      ggplot(data = t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nBecause moduleServer() already takes care of namespacing, redeclaring NS(id) inside the function causes a mismatch between the IDs in the UI and those in the server, so the generated outputs (verbatimTextOutput, plotOutput, etc.) don’t render. By using session$ns instead, everything lines up correctly.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The problem is using `NS(id)` again inside the moduleServer function\n2. The correct solution is to use `session$ns` instead\n3.

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly identifies that using `session$ns` instead of `NS(id)` is necessary to maintain the proper hierarchical namespace in nested Shiny modules.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Identifies the core problem - using `NS(id)` in the server function creates a new namespace that doesn't incorporate the parent module's namespace\n2. Provides the correct solution - changing `ns <- NS(id)` to `ns <- session$ns` in the innerServer function\n3. Explains why this works - that `session$ns` ensures the module inherits the full namespace path (e.g., \"outer1-inner1\") rather than just using the module's direct ID\n4. Clearly demonstrates why the mismatch between UI and server namespaces was causing the outputs not to appear\n\nThe submission goes beyond the minimum by providing a complete working solution with code and a thorough explanation of the namespace inheritance issue in nested Shiny modules. It correctly addresses exactly what was described in the criterion - that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the hierarchical relationship, while `session$ns` ensures dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces.\n\nGRADE: C",

Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Identifies the core problem - using `NS(id)` in the server function creates a new namespace that doesn't incorporate the parent module's namespace\n2. Provides the correct solution - changing `ns <- NS(id)` to `ns <- session$ns` in the innerServer function\n3. Explains why this works - that `session$ns` ensures the module inherits the full namespace path (e.g., \"outer1-inner1\") rather than just using the module's direct ID\n4. Clearly demonstrates why the mismatch between UI and server namespaces was causing the outputs not to appear\n\nThe submission goes beyond the minimum by providing a complete working solution with code and a thorough explanation of the namespace inheritance issue in nested Shiny modules. It correctly addresses exactly what was described in the criterion - that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the hierarchical relationship, while `session$ns` ensures dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces.\n\nGRADE: C"

That way, the nested namespace for each module is correctly inherited from its parent.\n\nBelow is the corrected version of your code.

                  "text": "Judging by the error message, this almost always boils down to a mismatch between the package name in your DESCRIPTION (“Imports: spatialstuff”) and whatever the remote repository’s DESCRIPTION file calls the package (the “Package:” field). In other words, R is looking for a package actually named spatialstuff, but it does not find one in the repo org/spatial-Stuff. \n\nHere are the usual culprits:\n\n1. The “Package:” field in the remote package’s own DESCRIPTION is not actually spatialstuff. If, for example, that remote package’s DESCRIPTION says Package: spatialStuff (upper‐ vs lower‐case “S”), R will complain when it sees Imports: spatialstuff. The Imports entry must match exactly what appears in the remote package’s DESCRIPTION.\n\n2. The GitHub repo name and the package’s name often differ (and that’s fine), but you must be sure that your Remotes: line correctly points to the repo while the Imports: line matches the package’s internal declared name. For example, this is valid if the remote DESCRIPTION has Package: spatialstuff:\n\n   Imports:\n     spatialstuff\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff\n\n   …provided that org/spatial-Stuff is indeed the correct GitHub repo and inside that repo the DESCRIPTION’s Package field is exactly spatialstuff.\n\n3. Make sure there is no subdirectory structure or other corner case that requires telling Remotes to look in a subdir. For example:\n\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff, subdir = \"pkg\"\n\n   if the actual package code lives below pkg/.\n\nSo in short, it is a mismatch (i.e., user error in the DESCRIPTION fields). Double‐check that the “Package:” field in org/spatial-Stuff’s DESCRIPTION matches “Imports: spatialstuff”, and that you have spelled the GitHub repo path correctly in “Remotes:”. Once the names match perfectly, pkgdown (or pak, devtools, etc.) should be able to install the dependency without error.",

Make sure your Remotes entry is pointing to the correct GitHub reference.  \n   - Typically, specifying Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff is enough, as pak/devtools will detect that remote approach automatically.  \n   - However, if the remote repo has a subdirectory containing the package, or a non-default branch, you might need to specify that in the Remotes line, for example:  \n     \n     Remotes:  \n       org/spatial-Stuff@my-branch,  \n       org/spatial-Stuff/subdir/path  \n\n3. Case sensitivity matters.  \n   - If the remote package’s name is “spatialStuff” rather than “spatialstuff,” R sees them as different names. Your Imports must match precisely.\n\nSo in short, it is almost certainly a naming mismatch: the name in Imports (spatialstuff) must match exactly the “Package:” field in the remote’s DESCRIPTION.

                  "text": "The underlying issue is that you are injecting the method “foo” at runtime in the Parent’s constructor (via self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...), while also defining a method named foo at the class level in Child. R6 locks the binding for class-level methods, so reassigning a method of the same name inside the object leads to the “cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'” error. \n\nA simpler (and more idiomatic) approach is to define foo as a normal public method in the parent, and then override it in the child. For example:\n\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      # Override parent’s foo but still call it\n      super$foo()\n      print(\"child foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n\nWhen you run the above, you will see both “foo” and “child foo” printed, and you will not encounter a locked-binding error. \n\nWhy this works better:\n\n• By putting foo in Parent’s public = list(...), you define a proper method at class creation time (rather than injecting it into the object environment later).  \n• Overriding in the child class remains consistent with R6’s method-inheritance model.  \n• You avoid reassigning a locked binding, so there is no conflict between a dynamically inserted method and the class-level method definition.  \n\nIf you truly need to create methods on the fly, you must avoid naming them the same as a method in the public list or tell R6 to leave the class unlocked (lock_class = FALSE). However, for normal inheritance and overriding, defining the method publicly in the parent class is the recommended solution.",

'is' : 'are'} picks “is” when n == 1, otherwise “are.”  \n• paste0(\"'\", pset$id[!params], \"'\", collapse = \", \") inserts the comma-separated list.",

Desired outcome is shown in the `result` column:\n\n```\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n          ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n            \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n            \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n          )\npipe\n#> # A tibble: 2 x 3\n#>   referral_key appointment_key result      \n#>   <chr>        <chr>           <chr>       \n#> 1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1\n#> 2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2\n```\n\nHow can I do this with the tidyverse?\n***\n[Submission]: One straightforward way is to use a regular expression that captures each segment and then reassembles them with “T” and “A” in between. For example:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      appointment_key,\n      \"^(.+)\\\\|\\\\|(.+)\\\\|\\\\|(.+)$\",  # regex capturing three groups\n      \"\\\\1T\\\\2A\\\\3\"                  # replace with the three groups plus T and A\n    )\n  )\n\nExplanation of the regex:\n• ^ and $ are the start and end of the string.  \n• (.+)\\\\|\\\\|(.+)\\\\|\\\\|(.+) means “capture anything up to the first '||', anything up to the second '||', and then anything after that.”  \n• \"\\\\1T\\\\2A\\\\3\" tells str_replace to substitute back the first group, then “T”, the second group, then “A”, and finally the third group. This transforms \"4289||10410||1\" → \"4289T10410A1\".\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Internal functions (like closest()) are subject to change without notice, so dplyr does not officially support their use in other packages. This is why calls to dplyr::closest() fail and cause build/lint issues.\n\nHere’s how you can address it:\n\n1) Don’t rely on internal functions. See if there is a publicly exported dplyr function that does what you need or write your own equivalent.\n2) If you must call closest() (not recommended), you would have to do so via the triple-colon, for example dplyr:::closest(). However, this will trigger warnings in R CMD check and can break your package if dplyr changes internally—you almost certainly want to avoid this.\n\nHence, the real fix is to avoid using closest() altogether. Try to see if there’s a documented, exported function in dplyr (or in another tidyverse package) that covers the same use case—or implement your own."
