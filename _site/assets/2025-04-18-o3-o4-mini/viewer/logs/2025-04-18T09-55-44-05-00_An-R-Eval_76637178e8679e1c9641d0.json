Each bar should still be filled according to clarity.\n***\n[Submission]: # Converting to Proportions in a Stacked Bar Chart\n\nTo change the bar heights to represent proportions rather than counts, while still maintaining the clarity breakdown, we need to modify the `y` aesthetic in `geom_bar()`.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(count)/sum(after_stat(count)), fill = clarity)) +\n  ylab(\"Proportion\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())\n```\n\n## What This Code Does:\n\n1. `y = after_stat(count)/sum(after_stat(count))` - Calculates the proportion of each cut by dividing its count by the total number of diamonds\n2. `ylab(\"Proportion\")` - Updates the y-axis label to reflect that we're showing proportions\n3. `scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())` - Formats the y-axis to display percentages\n\nThis way, the height of each bar will show what proportion of all diamonds have a particular cut (e.g., what percentage are \"Ideal\" vs \"Fair\"), while the coloring still shows the clarity breakdown within each cut.\n***\n[Criterion]: Preferably: \n\n```\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count)), fill = clarity))\n```\n\nThe dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0, but it still works:\n\n```\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = ..count.. / sum(..count..), fill = clarity))\n```\n\nSimply setting `position = \"fill\" will result in each bar having a height of 1 and is not correct.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion by comparing its approach to the expected solution.\n\nThe submission provides two approaches:\n\n1. First approach: Groups by ID, checks for Type_II records with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`, and then creates all pairwise combinations of Type_I dates using `combn()` and checks if any pairs are within 90 days.\n\n2. Second approach: A more efficient version that avoids generating all date pairs, instead checking adjacent dates in a sorted list with `diff()`.\n\nComparing to the criterion solution:\n- Both the submission and criterion solutions correctly use `group_by()` and `summarize()`.\n- The criterion solution uses a simpler approach with `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` to check the Type_I condition.\n- The submission correctly implements both conditions and combines them with a logical OR.\n\nHowever, there's a subtle issue with the submission's second approach. Checking only adjacent dates with `any(diff(as.numeric(type_i_dates)) <= 90)` is not equivalent to checking all pairs. Dates could be more than 90 days apart consecutively but have pairs that are within 90 days of each other among non-adjacent dates.\n\nThe first approach in the submission is correct but less efficient than the criterion solution. The second approach has a logical error that could produce incorrect results in some cases.\n\nGRADE: P",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted solution correctly implements the criteria for setting the boolean flag:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\" OR\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet me analyze the submitted code:\n\nThe submission uses a tidyverse approach with these steps:\n1. It checks for \"Type_II\" presence with `has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\")`, which is correct.\n2. For the \"Type_I\" condition, it:\n   - Collects all Type_I dates\n   - Uses `combn()` to create all possible date pairs\n   - Checks if any pair has a difference ≤ 90 days\n\nThe solution is technically complete and attempts to address both criteria, but there's a significant issue with the Type_I implementation:\n\nThe `combn()` approach is inefficient and potentially problematic for large datasets. More importantly, the logic for checking date differences has a flaw - it's using `abs()` on the date differences, which means it would flag cases that are within 90 days even if they're in the wrong chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, the code is unnecessarily complex with repeated `group_by(ID)` calls and the creation of list columns that aren't needed.\n\nThe criterion's simpler approach using either:\n1. `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` or\n2. `flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90`\n\nwould be more efficient and clearer.\n\nWhile the submitted solution would produce correct results for the example data, it's overly complex and contains the potential logical flaw regarding the date differences.\n\nGRADE: P",

Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet me analyze the submitted code:\n\nThe submission uses a tidyverse approach with these steps:\n1. It checks for \"Type_II\" presence with `has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\")`, which is correct.\n2. For the \"Type_I\" condition, it:\n   - Collects all Type_I dates\n   - Uses `combn()` to create all possible date pairs\n   - Checks if any pair has a difference ≤ 90 days\n\nThe solution is technically complete and attempts to address both criteria, but there's a significant issue with the Type_I implementation:\n\nThe `combn()` approach is inefficient and potentially problematic for large datasets. More importantly, the logic for checking date differences has a flaw - it's using `abs()` on the date differences, which means it would flag cases that are within 90 days even if they're in the wrong chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, the code is unnecessarily complex with repeated `group_by(ID)` calls and the creation of list columns that aren't needed.\n\nThe criterion's simpler approach using either:\n1. `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` or\n2. `flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90`\n\nwould be more efficient and clearer.\n\nWhile the submitted solution would produce correct results for the example data, it's overly complex and contains the potential logical flaw regarding the date differences.\n\nGRADE: P"

For the \"Type_I\" condition, it:\n   - Collects all Type_I dates\n   - Uses `combn()` to create all possible date pairs\n   - Checks if any pair has a difference ≤ 90 days\n\nThe solution is technically complete and attempts to address both criteria, but there's a significant issue with the Type_I implementation:\n\nThe `combn()` approach is inefficient and potentially problematic for large datasets. More importantly, the logic for checking date differences has a flaw - it's using `abs()` on the date differences, which means it would flag cases that are within 90 days even if they're in the wrong chronological order.\n\nAdditionally, the code is unnecessarily complex with repeated `group_by(ID)` calls and the creation of list columns that aren't needed.\n\nThe criterion's simpler approach using either:\n1. `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` or\n2. `flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90`\n\nwould be more efficient and clearer.\n\nWhile the submitted solution would produce correct results for the example data, it's overly complex and contains the potential logical flaw regarding the date differences.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer correctly implements the required flag creation based on the criterion provided.\n\nThe submission offers two different approaches:\n\n1. The first approach groups by ID, checks for Type_II instances, and then checks for Type_I instances within 90 days using expand.grid to create all possible date pairs.\n\n2. The second approach separates the process by first finding IDs with Type_II, then finding IDs with Type_I records within 90 days using a self-join, and finally combines the results.\n\nLet me analyze the correctness of these approaches:\n\nFor the Type_II check, both approaches correctly identify IDs with at least one Type_II record.\n\nFor the Type_I check, the submission is attempting to find pairs of Type_I records within 90 days of each other. However, there's a critical issue in both approaches: they check if the absolute difference between dates is ≤ 90 days, which means they would consider dates that are up to 90 days apart in either direction. This would work for the given example but isn't precisely what the criterion is requesting.\n\nThe criterion solution is more direct and elegant:\n- It uses `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` which correctly checks for consecutive Type_I records within 90 days of each other\n- Or the alternative approach that flags records within 90 days of the previous one with `flag_90d = date - lag(date, n = 1) <= 90`\n\nThe submission's approach is conceptually valid but more complex than necessary and could potentially lead to errors in edge cases.

Checking for \"Type_I\" instances within 90 days for each ID\n3. Combining these criteria to create the final flag\n\nHere's the solution using the tidyverse approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  # First, check if ID has Type_II\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\")) %>%\n  \n  # Now check for Type_I instances within 90 days\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_close_type_i = {\n    type_i_dates <- date[type == \"Type_I\"]\n    if(length(type_i_dates) >= 2) {\n      # Create all possible date pairs\n      date_pairs <- expand.grid(date1 = type_i_dates, date2 = type_i_dates)\n      # Check if any different pairs are within 90 days\n      any(abs(as.numeric(date_pairs$date1 - date_pairs$date2)) <= 90 & \n          date_pairs$date1 != date_pairs$date2)\n    } else {\n      FALSE\n    }\n  }) %>%\n  \n  # Create the final flag and keep only unique IDs\n  mutate(Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii | has_close_type_i)) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag) %>%\n  distinct()\n```\n\n## Alternative More Efficient Solution\n\nFor larger datasets, here's a more efficient approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Check for Type_II\nhas_type_ii <- df %>%\n  filter(type == \"Type_II\") %>%\n  distinct(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_type_ii = TRUE)\n\n# Check for Type_I within 90 days\nhas_close_type_i <- df %>%\n  filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>%\n  select(ID, date) %>%\n  # Self-join to create all date pairs for each ID\n  inner_join(df %>% filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>% select(ID, date2 = date), by = \"ID\") %>%\n  # Filter for different dates within 90 days\n  filter(date != date2, abs(as.numeric(date - date2)) <= 90) %>%\n  distinct(ID) %>%\n  mutate(has_close_type_i = TRUE)\n\n# Combine results\nresult <- df %>%\n  distinct(ID) %>%\n  left_join(has_type_ii, by = \"ID\") %>%\n  left_join(has_close_type_i, by = \"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(has_type_ii = replace_na(has_type_ii, FALSE),\n         has_close_type_i = replace_na(has_close_type_i, FALSE),\n         Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii | has_close_type_i)) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\nThis solution correctly identifies:\n- IDs with at least one \"Type_II\" record\n- IDs with at least two \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other \n- Sets the flag to 1 if either condition is met\n\nWould you like me to explain any particular part of the solution in more detail?",

The approach is consistent with the example solution provided, though with additional features like sizing points by frequency and adding a trend line.\n\nGRADE: C",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: # Visualizing Temporal Correlation in Flight Delays\n\nTo visualize how a flight's departure delay relates to the delay of the preceding flight from the same airport, I'll use dplyr's `lag()` function after arranging flights chronologically within each day and origin airport.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Remove flights with missing departure delay or time\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_time)) %>%\n  \n  # Group by origin airport and date\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  \n  # Sort chronologically within each group\n  arrange(dep_time, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  \n  # Get the previous flight's delay\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  \n  # Remove rows where there's no previous flight\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay)) %>%\n  \n  # Group by previous delay to calculate mean delay\n  group_by(prev_delay) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_delay = mean(dep_delay),\n    count = n()\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Create the visualization\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay, y = mean_delay, size = sqrt(count))) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"How previous flight delays affect subsequent flights\",\n    subtitle = \"From the same airport on the same day\",\n    size = \"Number of flights\"\n  ) +\n  # Focus on main part of data\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-20, 120), ylim = c(-10, 60)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis visualization shows:\n\n1. The x-axis represents the delay of the previous flight from the same airport\n2. The y-axis shows the mean delay of flights following that delayed flight\n3. Point size indicates how many flights had that specific previous delay value\n4. The smooth trend line reveals the relationship between consecutive flight delays\n\nThe positive correlation in the trend line confirms that delays are indeed temporally correlated - when one flight is delayed, subsequent flights tend to experience delays as well.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The approach is consistent with the example solution provided, though with additional features like sizing points by frequency and adding a trend line.\n\nGRADE: C"

I first sorted the flights by origin airport and actual departure time to establish the correct sequence of flights.\n\n2. Using `lag()` within each origin airport group, I created a column containing the departure delay of the previous flight.\n\n3. I then calculated the mean departure delay for each value of previous flight delay, and included a count of flights to understand data density.\n\n4.

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Here are two approaches:\n\n## Option 1: Add a dummy point with NA coordinates\n\n```r\n# Original data\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add a dummy point for level 'd'\ndf_with_dummy <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_with_dummy) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nThis works because NA values contribute to the legend but don't appear in the plot itself.\n\n## Option 2: Add a dummy point outside the plot area\n\n```r\n# Add a dummy point far outside the visible area\ndf_with_dummy <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = -999, y = -999, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_with_dummy) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  xlim(1, 3) +  # Restrict view to exclude the dummy point\n  ylim(1, 3)\n```\n\nThe first approach with NA values is usually cleaner since you don't need to set explicit plot limits.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

When you have spaces, commas, or other special characters in a URL, they need to be properly encoded.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstead of manually constructing the URL with `glue`, use httr2's built-in functions for handling query parameters:\n\n```r\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  httr2::req_url_query(\n    q = address,\n    api_key = api_key\n  ) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\nThis approach has several advantages:\n- It properly encodes all parameters\n- It handles special characters automatically\n- It's more readable and maintainable\n\n## Alternative Solution\n\nIf you prefer to use `glue`, you need to manually encode the address:\n\n```r\naddress <- URLencode(\"Prince st., New York 10012\", reserved = TRUE)\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\nurl <- glue::glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\nThe first approach using `req_url_query()` is generally recommended as it's more robust and less error-prone.",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion of correctly modifying the code to use named breaks as labels by default for discrete scales.\n\nThe criterion specifically identifies two changes that need to be made:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve the names.\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve the names when mapping breaks.\n\nLooking at the submission, the approach taken is different. Instead of modifying how breaks are preserved with `setNames()`, the submission adds a conditional block in the `init` function that:\n- Checks if labels are not specified (waiver) and the scale is discrete\n- Gets the breaks (evaluating if they're a function)\n- Uses the names of breaks as labels if they exist\n\nWhile this approach might achieve a similar end result in some cases, it doesn't exactly match the required changes specified in the criterion. The submission modifies how labels are set based on break names, but doesn't ensure names are properly preserved throughout the process as the criterion specifies.\n\nThe approach in the submission is not incorrect conceptually, but it doesn't implement the specific code changes required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

If the breaks have names, uses those names as the labels\n\nThis way, when using discrete scales with named breaks, those names will automatically be used as labels for the secondary axis.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve the names.\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve the names when mapping breaks.\n\nLooking at the submission, the approach taken is different. Instead of modifying how breaks are preserved with `setNames()`, the submission adds a conditional block in the `init` function that:\n- Checks if labels are not specified (waiver) and the scale is discrete\n- Gets the breaks (evaluating if they're a function)\n- Uses the names of breaks as labels if they exist\n\nWhile this approach might achieve a similar end result in some cases, it doesn't exactly match the required changes specified in the criterion. The submission modifies how labels are set based on break names, but doesn't ensure names are properly preserved throughout the process as the criterion specifies.\n\nThe approach in the submission is not incorrect conceptually, but it doesn't implement the specific code changes required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

Checks if labels are not specified (waiver) and we're dealing with a discrete scale\n2. Gets the breaks, evaluating them if they're a function\n3. If the breaks have names, uses those names as the labels\n\nThis way, when using discrete scales with named breaks, those names will automatically be used as labels for the secondary axis.",

          "explanation": "I'm evaluating whether the submission meets the criterion for editing the code to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes that need to be made:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission does not make either of these specific changes. Instead, it proposes a different approach by adding conditional logic in the `init` method that would check for named breaks and explicitly set the labels based on those names. While this approach tries to address the same problem, it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion.\n\nThe required changes focus on preserving the names of breaks throughout the processing pipeline, while the submission focuses on extracting those names at one point to set the labels. Both approaches might work, but they're different implementation strategies, and the submission doesn't match what the criterion specifies.\n\nGRADE: I",

The issue is in the `init` method of the `AxisSecondary` class, where it needs additional logic to check for named breaks when labels are set to `waiver()`.\n\nHere's my proposed edit:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # For discrete scales, if breaks have names and labels are waiver(),\n    # use the names of the breaks as labels\n    if (is.character(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n    } else {\n      # Try to get labels from the scale if available\n      self$labels <- scale$get_labels()\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\nThis adds a new condition that checks:\n\n1. If labels are waiver() (meaning use defaults)\n2. If the scale is discrete\n3. If the breaks are named\n\nWhen these conditions are met, it uses the names of the breaks as labels. The fallback is to try getting labels from the scale itself when they're available.\n\nThis change will ensure that named breaks in discrete scales are properly passed through to become labels in the secondary axis, maintaining the same behavior as the primary axis.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The issue is in the `init` method of the `AxisSecondary` class, where it needs additional logic to check for named breaks when labels are set to `waiver()`.\n\nHere's my proposed edit:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # For discrete scales, if breaks have names and labels are waiver(),\n    # use the names of the breaks as labels\n    if (is.character(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n    } else {\n      # Try to get labels from the scale if available\n      self$labels <- scale$get_labels()\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\nThis adds a new condition that checks:\n\n1. If labels are waiver() (meaning use defaults)\n2. If the scale is discrete\n3. If the breaks are named\n\nWhen these conditions are met, it uses the names of the breaks as labels. The fallback is to try getting labels from the scale itself when they're available.\n\nThis change will ensure that named breaks in discrete scales are properly passed through to become labels in the secondary axis, maintaining the same behavior as the primary axis."

The issue is in the `init` method of the `AxisSecondary` class, where it needs additional logic to check for named breaks when labels are set to `waiver()`.\n\nHere's my proposed edit:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete()) {\n    # For discrete scales, if breaks have names and labels are waiver(),\n    # use the names of the breaks as labels\n    if (is.character(self$breaks) && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n      self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n    } else {\n      # Try to get labels from the scale if available\n      self$labels <- scale$get_labels()\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\nThis adds a new condition that checks:\n\n1. If labels are waiver() (meaning use defaults)\n2. If the scale is discrete\n3. If the breaks are named\n\nWhen these conditions are met, it uses the names of the breaks as labels. The fallback is to try getting labels from the scale itself when they're available.\n\nThis change will ensure that named breaks in discrete scales are properly passed through to become labels in the secondary axis, maintaining the same behavior as the primary axis.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submission meets the criterion described, which provides specific changes needed to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion proposes two specific changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving the names during the breaks initialization and mapping, it adds a check after setting the breaks and labels to use the break names as labels if they exist.\n\nWhile the submission's approach might work in some cases, it misses the fundamental issue: the names of the breaks are being lost during the initialization and mapping processes. The criterion correctly identifies that the fix needs to be at the points where breaks are being retrieved or mapped.\n\nThe solution in the criterion ensures that names are preserved throughout the process, while the submission tries to detect named breaks after they might have already lost their names.\n\nGRADE: I",

The breaks are not a function (so we can access their names)\n\nThen, if the breaks have names, we'll use those names as the labels. This ensures that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving the names during the breaks initialization and mapping, it adds a check after setting the breaks and labels to use the break names as labels if they exist.\n\nWhile the submission's approach might work in some cases, it misses the fundamental issue: the names of the breaks are being lost during the initialization and mapping processes. The criterion correctly identifies that the fix needs to be at the points where breaks are being retrieved or mapped.\n\nThe solution in the criterion ensures that names are preserved throughout the process, while the submission tries to detect named breaks after they might have already lost their names.\n\nGRADE: I"

Let me propose a change to fix this.\n\nThe issue is in the `init` method of the `AxisSecondary` ggproto object. Currently, it handles labels by inheriting from the primary scale or using waiver defaults, but doesn't check for named breaks specifically.\n\nHere's my proposed edit to the `init` method of `AxisSecondary`:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  # Add check for named breaks and use them as labels when appropriate\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.function(self$breaks)) {\n    if (!is.null(breaks_names <- names(self$breaks)) && length(breaks_names) > 0) {\n      self$labels <- breaks_names\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\nThis change adds a new condition after setting the breaks and labels. If:\n1. `self$labels` is a waiver (meaning no explicit labels were provided)\n2. The scale is discrete\n3. The breaks are not a function (so we can access their names)\n\nThen, if the breaks have names, we'll use those names as the labels. This ensures that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default."

Currently, it handles labels by inheriting from the primary scale or using waiver defaults, but doesn't check for named breaks specifically.\n\nHere's my proposed edit to the `init` method of `AxisSecondary`:\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  # Add check for named breaks and use them as labels when appropriate\n  if (is.waiver(self$labels) && scale$is_discrete() && !is.function(self$breaks)) {\n    if (!is.null(breaks_names <- names(self$breaks)) && length(breaks_names) > 0) {\n      self$labels <- breaks_names\n    }\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\nThis change adds a new condition after setting the breaks and labels. If:\n1. `self$labels` is a waiver (meaning no explicit labels were provided)\n2. The scale is discrete\n3. The breaks are not a function (so we can access their names)\n\nThen, if the breaks have names, we'll use those names as the labels. This ensures that when discrete breaks have names, those names will be used as labels by default.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly implements the three main steps required by the criterion:\n\n1) Grouped filtering to only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows per tailnum\n2) Grouped summarizing with mean(is.na(arr_delay)) to find the proportion of NA values\n3) Arranging by the resulting column in descending order\n\nLet's analyze the submitted code:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThe submission has a conceptual issue with the order of operations. It first groups by tailnum, summarizes to count flights and NA values, and then filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights. While this will produce the correct result, it does not follow the required approach of filtering first based on group size.\n\nThe criterion specifically mentions a \"grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows\" as the first step, which should be done with `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` in the new syntax or `group_by(tailnum) %>% filter(n() > 100)` in the old syntax.\n\nAdditionally, while calculating `proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights` is mathematically equivalent to `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, the criterion specifically states that the latter should be used.\n\nThe submission does correctly arrange by the proportion in descending order, but adds additional steps (`slice(1) %>% pull(tailnum)`) that were not required.\n\nSince the submission gets the filtering logic wrong (filtering after summarization instead of before) and doesn't use the specific approach required for calculating the proportion, but would still produce the correct answer, I will mark it as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

This requires grouping by tailnum, calculating the proportion of missing values, and filtering for planes with sufficient flights.\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # Group by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # Calculate relevant metrics\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delays = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  # Filter for planes with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  # Sort by proportion of NAs, highest first\n  arrange(desc(proportion_na)) %>%\n  # Get the top result\n  slice(1) %>%\n  # Just show the tailnum\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Groups the flight data by tailnum\n2. Counts the total flights and NA arrival delays for each plane\n3. Calculates the proportion of flights with missing arrival delay data\n4. Filters to only include planes that have flown 100+ flights\n5. Arranges in descending order of the NA proportion\n6. Returns the tailnum with the highest proportion\n\nThis will give us the plane that most frequently has missing arrival delay information among those with a substantial flight history.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It first groups by tailnum, summarizes to count flights and NA values, and then filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights. While this will produce the correct result, it does not follow the required approach of filtering first based on group size.\n\nThe criterion specifically mentions a \"grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows\" as the first step, which should be done with `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` in the new syntax or `group_by(tailnum) %>% filter(n() > 100)` in the old syntax.\n\nAdditionally, while calculating `proportion_na = na_arr_delays / total_flights` is mathematically equivalent to `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, the criterion specifically states that the latter should be used.\n\nThe submission does correctly arrange by the proportion in descending order, but adds additional steps (`slice(1) %>% pull(tailnum)`) that were not required.\n\nSince the submission gets the filtering logic wrong (filtering after summarization instead of before) and doesn't use the specific approach required for calculating the proportion, but would still produce the correct answer, I will mark it as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion for finding the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe submission uses the following approach:\n1. Groups by `tailnum`\n2. Creates a summary that calculates total flights, number of NA arrival delays, and the proportion\n3. Filters for planes with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranges by the proportion in descending order\n5. Selects the top result\n\nLooking at this against the criterion:\n\n- The criterion specifies that we should first filter grouped data to keep only those `tailnum`s with > 100 flights, then calculate the proportion of NAs. The submission does this in the reverse order - it calculates all statistics first, then filters.\n\n- The criterion specifically states we should use `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion, but the submission uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights`. While mathematically equivalent, it doesn't match the specified method.\n\n- The submission doesn't follow the specific workflow described in the criterion, which requires filtering first, then summarizing.\n\nWhile the submission would produce the correct answer, it doesn't follow the specified approach in the criterion. The key issue is that it summarizes first (calculating total flights) and then filters, rather than filtering first based on the group size.\n\nGRADE: P",

Groups the flights by aircraft tail number\n2. For each aircraft, calculates:\n   - Total number of flights\n   - Number of flights with missing arrival delay data\n   - Proportion of flights with missing arrival delay data\n3. Filters to include only aircraft with 100+ flights\n4. Sorts to find the aircraft with the highest proportion of missing values\n5. Returns just the tail number of that aircraft\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Groups by `tailnum`\n2. Creates a summary that calculates total flights, number of NA arrival delays, and the proportion\n3. Filters for planes with at least 100 flights\n4. Arranges by the proportion in descending order\n5. Selects the top result\n\nLooking at this against the criterion:\n\n- The criterion specifies that we should first filter grouped data to keep only those `tailnum`s with > 100 flights, then calculate the proportion of NAs. The submission does this in the reverse order - it calculates all statistics first, then filters.\n\n- The criterion specifically states we should use `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion, but the submission uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights`. While mathematically equivalent, it doesn't match the specified method.\n\n- The submission doesn't follow the specific workflow described in the criterion, which requires filtering first, then summarizing.\n\nWhile the submission would produce the correct answer, it doesn't follow the specified approach in the criterion. The key issue is that it summarizes first (calculating total flights) and then filters, rather than filtering first based on the group size.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion by analyzing its approach to the task.\n\nThe criterion specifies a three-step process:\n1. A grouped filter to keep only tailnums with > 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arrange in descending order\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nThe submission uses a different approach:\n- It groups by tailnum first\n- It summarizes to calculate total_flights and na_proportion (using sum(is.na(arr_delay))/total_flights)\n- It filters after summarizing (filter(total_flights >= 100))\n- It then arranges and pulls the result\n\nThis is fundamentally different from the expected approach. The submission calculates the total number of flights during summarization and then filters, rather than filtering first based on the number of rows in each group. The criterion specifies that \"no persistent summarization across rows should happen\" in step 1.\n\nAdditionally, while the submission correctly identifies that we need to calculate the proportion of NA values in arr_delay, it uses sum(is.na())/n() instead of mean(is.na()), which is functionally equivalent but not the specifically requested approach.\n\nThe submission correctly ignores the planes data, which is irrelevant to the task.\n\nGRADE: P",

Group flights by tailnum\n2. Count total flights and NA arr_delays for each tailnum\n3. Calculate the proportion of missing arrival delays\n4. Filter to include only planes with at least 100 flights\n5. Find the one with the highest proportion of NAs\n\nHere's the tidyverse code:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # Group by tailnum\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  \n  # Calculate number of flights and proportion of NA arr_delays\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_count = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    na_proportion = na_count / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  \n  # Sort by proportion of NAs in descending order\n  arrange(desc(na_proportion)) %>%\n  \n  # Get the tailnum with highest proportion\n  slice_head(n = 1) %>%\n  pull(tailnum)\n```\n\nThis code will return the tailnum of the aircraft that has the highest percentage of missing arrival delay values among all planes that have flown at least 100 flights.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

A grouped filter to keep only tailnums with > 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3. Arrange in descending order\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nThe submission uses a different approach:\n- It groups by tailnum first\n- It summarizes to calculate total_flights and na_proportion (using sum(is.na(arr_delay))/total_flights)\n- It filters after summarizing (filter(total_flights >= 100))\n- It then arranges and pulls the result\n\nThis is fundamentally different from the expected approach. The submission calculates the total number of flights during summarization and then filters, rather than filtering first based on the number of rows in each group. The criterion specifies that \"no persistent summarization across rows should happen\" in step 1.\n\nAdditionally, while the submission correctly identifies that we need to calculate the proportion of NA values in arr_delay, it uses sum(is.na())/n() instead of mean(is.na()), which is functionally equivalent but not the specifically requested approach.\n\nThe submission correctly ignores the planes data, which is irrelevant to the task.\n\nGRADE: P"

Identifies that the problem is with namespace handling in the dynamically generated UI\n2. Explains that using `ns <- NS(id)` inside the module server creates incorrect namespacing\n3. Provides a solution that replaces this with `session$ns` for namespace resolution inside `renderUI()`\n4. Shows the corrected code where `session$ns()` is used directly in the `renderUI()` function\n5. Explains that the issue was \"double-namespacing\" which prevented Shiny from finding the corresponding outputs\n\nThe submission aligns perfectly with the criterion's explanation. It correctly identifies and solves the namespace issue by using `session$ns` instead of creating a new namespace function with `NS(id)`.\n\nAlthough the submission uses `session$ns` directly in the `renderUI()` function rather than assigning it to a variable first (as shown in the criterion example), this is functionally equivalent and still addresses the core issue correctly.\n\nGRADE: C",

Using `NS(id)` inside a module creates incorrectly nested namespaces\n\n## The Solution\n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # Added this for ggplot\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # Remove the ns <- NS(id) line - it's incorrect here\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n    })\n    \n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        # Use session$ns for correct namespacing within the module\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # These are correct - innerServer will handle the namespacing\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n## Key Changes\n\n1. Removed `ns <- NS(id)` from inside the `innerServer` module server function\n2. Used `session$ns()` instead of `ns()` within the `renderUI()` call\n3. Added the missing `ggplot2` library import\n\n## Why This Works\n\n- `session$ns` provides the correct namespace context within a module server function\n- When generating UI elements dynamically, you need to ensure IDs are properly namespaced so they connect with their corresponding server components\n- The outer module correctly passes namespaced IDs to the inner modules\n\nThis should now properly display all components - the header, the verbatim text output, and the chart.",

When you create UI elements within a `renderUI()` inside a module, you need to use the `session$ns` function to correctly namespace the IDs.\n\n## The Problem\n\nIn your `innerServer` function, you're creating a new namespace (`ns <- NS(id)`) which is incorrect inside a module server function, because:\n\n1. You already have a namespace context from `moduleServer()`\n2. Using `NS(id)` inside a module creates incorrectly nested namespaces\n\n## The Solution\n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # Added this for ggplot\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # Remove the ns <- NS(id) line - it's incorrect here\n    \n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    \n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    \n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n    })\n    \n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        # Use session$ns for correct namespacing within the module\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # These are correct - innerServer will handle the namespacing\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n## Key Changes\n\n1. Removed `ns <- NS(id)` from inside the `innerServer` module server function\n2. Used `session$ns()` instead of `ns()` within the `renderUI()` call\n3. Added the missing `ggplot2` library import\n\n## Why This Works\n\n- `session$ns` provides the correct namespace context within a module server function\n- When generating UI elements dynamically, you need to ensure IDs are properly namespaced so they connect with their corresponding server components\n- The outer module correctly passes namespaced IDs to the inner modules\n\nThis should now properly display all components - the header, the verbatim text output, and the chart."

Try modifying your `Remotes` field in the DESCRIPTION file like this:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  org/spatial-Stuff@*release\n```\n\nOr be even more explicit with:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n  spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis explicitly tells R that the package `spatialstuff` should be installed from the repository `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n## Additional Troubleshooting\n\nIf the above doesn't work:\n\n1. **Check the package name**: Make sure the actual package name in the `DESCRIPTION` file inside `org/spatial-Stuff` is indeed `spatialstuff`\n\n2. **Try explicit GitHub prefix**:\n   ```\n   Remotes:\n     github::org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider using `Additional_repositories`** if the package is hosted on a non-standard repository\n\nThis is not user error - it's a common challenge when package names and repository names don't match exactly.",

Let's break down what's happening:\n\n1. In your inner function, you have `chat = chat` as a default parameter\n2. When R evaluates this, it creates a circular reference since the default value refers to itself\n3. This causes the \"promise already under evaluation\" error\n\n## Solution\n\nHere are three ways to fix this issue:\n\n### Option 1: Capture the outer function's value in the closure\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  chat_instance <- chat  # Store the chat object\n  \n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat_instance$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use a different parameter name to avoid confusion\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_obj = chat) {  # Different parameter name\n    ch <- chat_obj$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Remove the default argument in the inner function\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input) {  # No default chat argument\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe first option is usually the best practice as it explicitly captures the value from the outer function's scope, making the code clearer and avoiding potential issues with variable shadowing.\n***\n[Criterion]: It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The issue is in the inner function where you have `chat = chat` as a parameter.\n\n## The Problem\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) {  # This line causes the problem\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen R evaluates the default value for the inner function's `chat` parameter, it becomes confused - is this the outer function's `chat` parameter or is it recursively referring to itself?\n\n## Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Use different parameter names\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(outer_chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = outer_chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use R's lexical scoping (simpler option)\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input) {  # Remove the chat parameter entirely\n    ch <- chat$clone()  # This will use the outer function's chat\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Force evaluation with `force()`\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)  # Ensure chat is evaluated now\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI'd recommend Option 1 or 2 as they make the code clearer and avoid potential confusion about which `chat` is being referenced.",

The submission uses `{missing_params}` with a custom formatted string, while the expected solution uses `{.val {pset$id[!params]}}` which uses cli's built-in value formatting\n\nThe submission is on the right track and demonstrates good understanding of cli's string interpolation and pluralization features, but doesn't match the expected solution exactly. It's still a functional solution that would work similarly to the expected one, just with slight differences in formatting and pluralization.\n\nGRADE: P"

Moved all reactive expressions (`ckd_condition`, `visit_threshold`, `filtered_data`) inside the server function\n2. Added parentheses when calling reactive expressions: `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()`\n3. Included the entire plot rendering code inside the server function\n4. Removed the standalone `output$plot` line that was incorrectly placed in the server function\n\nIn Shiny, all reactive computations and outputs must be defined within the server function to have access to the input values and properly register as outputs."

The server function isn't actually creating any outputs - it's just referencing `output$plot`\n\n## Solution\n\nRestructure your app by moving all server-related code into the server function:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# Create a dropdown menu for the user to select the CKD condition level\n# and a numeric input field for the visit threshold\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(\n  ui = ui, \n  server = function(input, output) {\n    # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n    ckd_condition <- reactive({\n      input$condition\n    })\n    \n    visit_threshold <- reactive({\n      input$visit_threshold\n    })\n    \n    filtered_data <- reactive({\n      Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n        filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition(), VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold())\n    })\n    \n    # Create a linear model and visualization\n    output$plot <- renderPlot({\n      validate(\n        need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n        need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n      )\n      \n      # Filter the data based on the user's input\n      data <- filtered_data()\n      \n      # Create a linear model\n      lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n      \n      # Create a plot of the linear model\n      ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n        geom_point() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n        labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n    })\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## Key Changes Made:\n\n1. Moved all reactive expressions (`ckd_condition`, `visit_threshold`, `filtered_data`) inside the server function\n2. Added parentheses when calling reactive expressions: `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()`\n3. Included the entire plot rendering code inside the server function\n4. Removed the standalone `output$plot` line that was incorrectly placed in the server function\n\nIn Shiny, all reactive computations and outputs must be defined within the server function to have access to the input values and properly register as outputs.",

It correctly identifies the core issue that reactive expressions and output definitions were placed outside the server function.\n\n2. It provides a fixed solution that properly moves all the application logic inside a well-structured server function, including:\n   - Moving the reactive data filtering expression inside the server\n   - Properly defining `output$plot` with the renderPlot function inside the server\n   - Removing the separate standalone reactive functions for condition and threshold\n\n3. The submission clearly explains what was wrong in the original code, noting that \"all reactive expressions and output definitions were placed outside the server function\" and that \"the server function was just referencing `output$plot` without defining it.\"\n\nThe solution provided matches exactly what was expected according to the criterion - moving the plot rendering logic into a proper server function.\n\nGRADE: C",

The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It correctly identifies the core issue that reactive expressions and output definitions were placed outside the server function.\n\n2. It provides a fixed solution that properly moves all the application logic inside a well-structured server function, including:\n   - Moving the reactive data filtering expression inside the server\n   - Properly defining `output$plot` with the renderPlot function inside the server\n   - Removing the separate standalone reactive functions for condition and threshold\n\n3. The submission clearly explains what was wrong in the original code, noting that \"all reactive expressions and output definitions were placed outside the server function\" and that \"the server function was just referencing `output$plot` without defining it.\"\n\nThe solution provided matches exactly what was expected according to the criterion - moving the plot rendering logic into a proper server function.\n\nGRADE: C"

In your original code, the server function was just referencing `output$plot` without defining it\n3. Your server function was structured incorrectly - it wasn't actually containing the logic needed\n\nThis revised code properly places all reactive code inside the server function, which is how Shiny is designed to work.",

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission correctly identifies and fixes the issue with the `output$plot` in the server function.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the main problem: the reactive expressions and the `output$plot` definition are outside the server function, and inside the server function there's only a reference to `output$plot` without any assignment.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission:\n1. Moves all reactive expressions inside the server function (correct)\n2. Properly defines `output$plot` with the rendering code inside the server function (correct)\n3. Fixes the reactive value calls by adding parentheses (e.g., `ckd_condition()`) (correct)\n\nThis solution matches the approach described in the criterion. Both the submission and the criterion identify that the server function needs to properly define the plot output with rendering code, not just reference it.\n\nThe submission's implementation is actually more complete than the criterion example, as it preserves the intermediary reactive functions, though both solutions would work correctly.\n\nGRADE: C",

You're not calling your reactive values as functions when using them\n\n## Fixed Code\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# Create a dropdown menu for the user to select the CKD condition level\n# and a numeric input field for the visit threshold\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(\n  ui = ui, \n  server = function(input, output) {\n    # Create a reactive function to filter the data based on user input\n    ckd_condition <- reactive({\n      input$condition\n    })\n    \n    visit_threshold <- reactive({\n      input$visit_threshold\n    })\n    \n    filtered_data <- reactive({\n      Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n        filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition(), VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold())\n    })\n    \n    # Create a linear model and visualization\n    output$plot <- renderPlot({\n      validate(\n        need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n        need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n      )\n      # Filter the data based on the user's input\n      data <- filtered_data()\n      \n      # Create a linear model\n      lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n      \n      # Create a plot of the linear model\n      ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n        geom_point() + \n        geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n        labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n    })\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## Key Fixes Made\n\n1. **Moved all reactive logic inside the server function** - All reactive expressions and outputs need to be defined inside the server function.\n\n2. **Added parentheses to reactive values** - When using reactive values like `ckd_condition`, you need to call them as functions: `ckd_condition()`.\n\n3. **Properly assigned the plot output** - In your original code, the server function only contained `output$plot` without any assignment, which just references the value but doesn't create it.\n\nThis should fix your error and get your Shiny app working properly.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Moves all reactive expressions inside the server function (correct)\n2. Properly defines `output$plot` with the rendering code inside the server function (correct)\n3. Fixes the reactive value calls by adding parentheses (e.g., `ckd_condition()`) (correct)\n\nThis solution matches the approach described in the criterion. Both the submission and the criterion identify that the server function needs to properly define the plot output with rendering code, not just reference it.\n\nThe submission's implementation is actually more complete than the criterion example, as it preserves the intermediary reactive functions, though both solutions would work correctly.\n\nGRADE: C"

When Google's OAuth response includes `refresh_token_expires_in` but no `refresh_token`, the `$` operator is doing a partial match between `refresh_token` and `refresh_token_expires_in`, causing unexpected behavior.\n\nTo avoid partial matching, we should use the `[[` operator which requires exact matching:\n\n```r\ntoken_refresh <- function(client, refresh_token, scope = NULL, token_params = list()) {\n  out <- oauth_client_get_token(\n    client,\n    grant_type = \"refresh_token\",\n    refresh_token = refresh_token,\n    scope = scope,\n    !!!token_params\n  )\n  out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token\n  out\n}\n```\n\nThe `[[` operator performs exact matching unlike `$`, which will prevent the unintended partial match with `refresh_token_expires_in`.

The first `str_replace()` changes the first occurrence of `||` to \"T\"\n2. The second `str_replace()` changes the second occurrence of `||` to \"A\"\n\nThe `\\\\|\\\\|` syntax is needed because the pipe character `|` has special meaning in regular expressions, so it needs to be escaped with backslashes.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`.

Here's the updated version of your code:\n\n```r\nexpect_warning(\n  check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n  \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\"\n)\n```\n\n## Key Changes:\n\n1. **Regular expressions**: In the 3rd edition, the warning message is matched as a plain string by default, not a regex pattern, so you don't need to escape the backticks or parentheses.\n\n2. **Alternative approaches** (if needed):\n   - If you specifically want to use regex matching: `expect_warning(..., regexp = \"pattern\")`\n   - For a more modern approach, you could use: `expect_snapshot_warning(check_ellipses(...))`\n\nThe simplest transition is what I've shown above, which will work with testthat 3rd edition while maintaining the same test behavior.\n***\n[Criterion]: Instead of the regex, test the warning message with a snapshot:\n\n```\nexpect_snapshot(\n  .res <- check_ellipses(\n    \"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE\n  )\n)\n```\n\nAssigning to some intermediate value like `.res <- ` is nice as it prevents the result from being inlined into the snapshot.

If you simply want to create a new column called \"x\", it's more straightforward to use regular `mutate()` syntax as shown in the third example.\n\n3. The strange characters (`栀Ƭ`) at the end of your code appear to be a copy-paste error and should be removed.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a trailing comma after `.names = \"x\"` that needs to be removed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

                  "text": "# Handling Non-Exported Functions in R Packages\n\nIt appears you're trying to use `closest()` from dplyr, but encountering an issue because it's not an exported function. This is a common challenge when dealing with internal/non-exported functions in R packages.\n\n## The Problem\n\nWhen a function isn't exported from a package's namespace, you can't access it with `package::function()` syntax, which is why you're getting:\n\n```r\nError: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'\n```\n\n## Solutions\n\nHere are several approaches you can take:\n\n### 1. Use `:::` (Triple Colon) - Not Recommended for Packages\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()\n```\n\nWhile this works interactively, it's not recommended for packages as it creates a dependency on internal functions that might change without notice. CRAN also generally won't accept packages using `:::`.\n\n### 2. Copy the Function Definition\n\nIf the function is simple and license-compatible, copy the implementation into your package with proper attribution.\n\n### 3. Use the `importIntoNamespace()` Function\n\nIn your package's `.onLoad()` function:\n\n```r\n.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {\n  closest <- utils::getFromNamespace(\"closest\", \"dplyr\")\n  assignInNamespace(\"closest\", closest, ns = pkgname)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Best Solution: Find an Alternative Approach\n\n* Check if there's an exported function that serves the same purpose\n* Look for equivalent functionality in other packages\n* Contact dplyr maintainers to ask about the intended usage\n\n## For Your Linting Issues\n\nIf you're using `closest()` directly and it's working but causing lint issues, you may have inadvertently imported the entire dplyr namespace with `@import dplyr`. To fix the lint warnings:\n\n```r\n# Add to your DESCRIPTION file\nImports: dplyr\n\n# In your R code, document the dependency:\n#' @importFrom dplyr filter select # list only exported functions you use\n```\n\nLet me know which approach works best for your situation!",

Use the triple colon operator to access internal functions\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest()\n```\n\nNote the triple colon (:::) which accesses non-exported functions. However, this is discouraged because:\n- Internal functions can change without notice\n- CRAN will flag this in package checks\n\n### 2. Copy the function into your own package (preferred)\n\nThe better approach is to copy the function code into your package with attribution:\n\n```r\n# R/utils.R\n#' Find closest value\n#' \n#' This function is adapted from dplyr's internal closest() function\n#' @keywords internal\nclosest <- function(...) {\n  # Copy the implementation here\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Find an alternative exported function\n\nDepending on what you're using `closest()` for, there might be exported functions that provide similar functionality:\n\n- `dplyr::near()` for approximate equality\n- Functions from the `nabor` or `FNN` packages for nearest neighbor problems\n\n## Fixing Lint Issues\n\nFor your linting issues, you can:\n\n1.
