The `prop` statistic in ggplot2 when used with `group = 1` is defined as the proportion of the count over the total count, which is mathematically equivalent to `count / sum(count)`. The submission correctly notes that setting `group = 1` ensures the proportion is computed over the entire dataset.\n\nThe submission also correctly avoids using `position = \"fill\"`, which would have resulted in each bar having a height of 1 (not showing the overall proportion of diamonds with each cut).\n\nThe submitted solution is functionally equivalent to the preferred solution in the criterion and will produce the desired visualization, where bar heights represent proportions of diamonds with each cut.\n\nGRADE: C",

At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet me analyze the submitted answer:\n\nThe submission uses a tidyverse approach that:\n1. Arranges the data by ID and date\n2. Creates a \"gap\" variable measuring days between consecutive visits\n3. Creates a logical variable \"two_I_90\" that identifies consecutive Type_I visits within 90 days\n4. Summarizes by ID to create a Flag that is 1 if either condition is met\n\nThe solution correctly implements the first condition by checking `any(type == \"Type_II\")`.\n\nFor the second condition, the approach identifies pairs of consecutive Type_I visits where the gap is ≤ 90 days using `two_I_90 = type == \"Type_I\" & lag(type) == \"Type_I\" & gap <= 90`. This correctly implements the condition of having \"Two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\"\n\nThe final flag is calculated as an integer conversion of either condition being true.\n\nThe solution produces the expected output as shown in the example table, and the approach is efficient and follows tidyverse principles.

Creates a logical variable \"two_I_90\" that identifies consecutive Type_I visits within 90 days\n4. Summarizes by ID to create a Flag that is 1 if either condition is met\n\nThe solution correctly implements the first condition by checking `any(type == \"Type_II\")`.\n\nFor the second condition, the approach identifies pairs of consecutive Type_I visits where the gap is ≤ 90 days using `two_I_90 = type == \"Type_I\" & lag(type) == \"Type_I\" & gap <= 90`. This correctly implements the condition of having \"Two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\"\n\nThe final flag is calculated as an integer conversion of either condition being true.\n\nThe solution produces the expected output as shown in the example table, and the approach is efficient and follows tidyverse principles. The explanation is also clear and thorough.\n\nGRADE: C"

At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet me analyze the submitted answer:\n\nThe submission uses a tidyverse approach that:\n1. Arranges the data by ID and date\n2. Creates a \"gap\" variable measuring days between consecutive visits\n3. Creates a logical variable \"two_I_90\" that identifies consecutive Type_I visits within 90 days\n4. Summarizes by ID to create a Flag that is 1 if either condition is met\n\nThe solution correctly implements the first condition by checking `any(type == \"Type_II\")`.\n\nFor the second condition, the approach identifies pairs of consecutive Type_I visits where the gap is ≤ 90 days using `two_I_90 = type == \"Type_I\" & lag(type) == \"Type_I\" & gap <= 90`. This correctly implements the condition of having \"Two or more cases of Type_I that occur within at least 90 days of one another.\"\n\nThe final flag is calculated as an integer conversion of either condition being true.\n\nThe solution produces the expected output as shown in the example table, and the approach is efficient and follows tidyverse principles. The explanation is also clear and thorough.\n\nGRADE: C"

At least one \"Type_II\" record\n2.

The code is only checking consecutive pairs using `lead()`, which works fine if the dates are ordered (which they are due to the `arrange()` call). But this approach would miss cases where non-consecutive Type_I records are within 90 days of each other.\n\nLooking at the criterion solution, it uses `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"]))` to handle this more robustly, ensuring all pairs of Type_I dates are considered, not just consecutive ones.\n\nDespite this potential issue, the submitted solution appears to produce the correct result for the given example data. The approach is sound and demonstrates good understanding of tidyverse syntax and logic.\n\nGRADE: C",

The code is only checking consecutive pairs using `lead()`, which works fine if the dates are ordered (which they are due to the `arrange()` call). But this approach would miss cases where non-consecutive Type_I records are within 90 days of each other.\n\nLooking at the criterion solution, it uses `diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"]))` to handle this more robustly, ensuring all pairs of Type_I dates are considered, not just consecutive ones.\n\nDespite this potential issue, the submitted solution appears to produce the correct result for the given example data. The approach is sound and demonstrates good understanding of tidyverse syntax and logic.\n\nGRADE: C",

          "explanation": "I'll assess the submitted answer based on the given criterion.\n\nThe submission meets the requirements in the following ways:\n\n1. **Grouping by origin**: The code correctly groups by `origin` before applying `lag()`, ensuring that only flights from the same airport are considered sequentially related. This is done with `group_by(origin)` followed by arranging within those groups using `.by_group = TRUE`.\n\n2. **Computing lagged departure delay**: The code uses `lag(dep_delay)` to obtain the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight from the same origin.\n\n3. **Taking mean departure delay by lagged delay**: The submission correctly groups by `prev_dep_delay` and calculates the mean current delay for each value of the previous delay.\n\n4. **Handling NA values**: The code filters out rows where either the current delay or the previous delay is NA, and also includes `na.rm = TRUE` in the mean calculation.\n\n5. **Visualization**: The code creates an appropriate visualization showing the relationship between the previous flight's delay and the mean delay of the current flight.\n\nThe approach uses the standard tidyverse workflow and meets all the requirements specified in the criterion. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes appropriate labels for the visualization.\n\nGRADE: C",

This is done with `group_by(origin)` followed by arranging within those groups using `.by_group = TRUE`.\n\n2. **Computing lagged departure delay**: The code uses `lag(dep_delay)` to obtain the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight from the same origin.\n\n3. **Taking mean departure delay by lagged delay**: The submission correctly groups by `prev_dep_delay` and calculates the mean current delay for each value of the previous delay.\n\n4. **Handling NA values**: The code filters out rows where either the current delay or the previous delay is NA, and also includes `na.rm = TRUE` in the mean calculation.\n\n5. **Visualization**: The code creates an appropriate visualization showing the relationship between the previous flight's delay and the mean delay of the current flight.\n\nThe approach uses the standard tidyverse workflow and meets all the requirements specified in the criterion. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes appropriate labels for the visualization.\n\nGRADE: C"

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

The mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable\n3. NAs need to be removed at some point\n\nLooking at the submitted code:\n\n- It correctly groups by `origin` when creating the lagged variable with `group_by(origin)` before using `mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay))`\n- It arranges by `origin, time_hour, dep_time` to ensure flights are in the correct temporal order within each airport\n- It filters out NA values with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay))` and `filter(!is.na(prev_delay))`\n- It groups by the lagged departure delay with `group_by(prev_delay)` before calculating the mean\n- It uses `mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)` to handle any remaining NAs\n- It creates a visualization showing the relationship between previous flight delay and current flight mean delay\n\nThe submission follows all the requirements specified in the criterion. It correctly groups by origin when creating the lag, calculates the mean delay grouped by the previous flight's delay, and handles NA values appropriately.\n\nGRADE: C",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Keep the request as GET but *after* you add the body tell `httr2` to use the\n   GET verb again:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- request(\"https://xxxxx\") |>\n  req_headers(\n    accept       = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey       = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) |>\n  req_body_json(list(\n    id          = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )) |>\n  req_method(\"GET\")               # <‑‑ force GET **after** req_body_json()\n\none2 |> req_perform()\n```\n\n2. (Preferable for many APIs) Put the parameters in the query string and send a\n   normal GET without a body:\n\n```r\none2 <- request(\"https://xxxxx\") |>\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) |>\n  req_url_query(\n    id          = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 |> req_perform()\n```\n\nEither approach will avoid the 405 error; choose the one that matches the way\nthe API is documented.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion, which suggests specific code changes to enable named discrete breaks to be used as labels by default in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific changes:\n1. Modify `if (scale$is_discrete()) { self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks() }` to use `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names\n2. Modify `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping\n\nThe submission takes a completely different approach. Instead of preserving names through the process, it:\n1. Adds documentation about the behavior\n2. Adds a new code block to `AxisSecondary$init()` that checks for named breaks, and if found:\n   - Copies the names to `self$labels`\n   - Removes the names from `self$breaks`\n3. Suggests optional unit tests\n\nWhile the submission's approach achieves a similar goal (using named breaks as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifically focuses on preserving break names throughout the process, while the submission extracts and separates the names early on.\n\nThe submission's approach might work functionally, but since it doesn't implement the exact changes specified in the criterion, it cannot be considered correct according to the given requirements.\n\nGRADE: I",

Documentation – advertise the new default\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nInside the `@param labels` field (and/or in the *Details* section) add one\nline:\n\n```\n- If the scale is discrete and `breaks` is a named vector,\n  those names are used as labels when `labels` is not supplied.\n```\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n2.  Code – teach `AxisSecondary` to look at the break names\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nInsert the following block at the end of `AxisSecondary$init()`, **after**\n`self$breaks`, `self$labels`, and `self$guide` have been finalised, i.e.\njust before the function returns.\n\n```r\n# If the scale is discrete and the breaks vector is named, use the\n# names as default labels (unless the user supplied labels explicitly).\nif (scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n    length(names(self$breaks)) > 0 &&\n    is.waiver(self$labels)) {\n\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  self$breaks <- unname(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nExactly the same three‑line idiom is used in the primary discrete scales,\nso this keeps secondary axes consistent.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  (optional) unit tests\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAdd a small test to `test-sec_axis.R` (or equivalent) along the lines of\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"named discrete breaks become default labels\", {\n  ax <- sec_axis(~ ., breaks = c(a = \"foo\", b = \"bar\"))\n  sc <- scale_x_discrete()\n  ax$init(sc)\n  expect_equal(ax$labels, c(\"a\", \"b\"))\n  expect_null(names(ax$breaks))\n})\n```\n\nNo other part of the secondary‑axis code needs to be touched: the labels\nare now in place before `break_info()` is ever called, and everything\ndown‑stream already works with an explicit character vector of labels.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n• one roxygen bullet explaining the behaviour  \n• six new lines in `AxisSecondary$init()` implementing the behaviour  \n• (optionally) a short regression test\n\nWith these changes, users can write e.g.\n\n```r\nscale_x_discrete(sec.axis = sec_axis(breaks = c(A = \"α\", B = \"β\")))\n```\n\nand get Greek letters on the secondary axis without having to repeat the\ninformation in a separate `labels` argument.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Modify `if (scale$is_discrete()) { self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks() }` to use `setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names\n2. Modify `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during mapping\n\nThe submission takes a completely different approach. Instead of preserving names through the process, it:\n1. Adds documentation about the behavior\n2. Adds a new code block to `AxisSecondary$init()` that checks for named breaks, and if found:\n   - Copies the names to `self$labels`\n   - Removes the names from `self$breaks`\n3. Suggests optional unit tests\n\nWhile the submission's approach achieves a similar goal (using named breaks as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifically focuses on preserving break names throughout the process, while the submission extracts and separates the names early on.\n\nThe submission's approach might work functionally, but since it doesn't implement the exact changes specified in the criterion, it cannot be considered correct according to the given requirements.\n\nGRADE: I"

Code – teach `AxisSecondary` to look at the break names\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nInsert the following block at the end of `AxisSecondary$init()`, **after**\n`self$breaks`, `self$labels`, and `self$guide` have been finalised, i.e.\njust before the function returns.\n\n```r\n# If the scale is discrete and the breaks vector is named, use the\n# names as default labels (unless the user supplied labels explicitly).\nif (scale$is_discrete() &&\n    !is.null(names(self$breaks)) &&\n    length(names(self$breaks)) > 0 &&\n    is.waiver(self$labels)) {\n\n  self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  self$breaks <- unname(self$breaks)\n}\n```\n\nExactly the same three‑line idiom is used in the primary discrete scales,\nso this keeps secondary axes consistent.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  (optional) unit tests\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nAdd a small test to `test-sec_axis.R` (or equivalent) along the lines of\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"named discrete breaks become default labels\", {\n  ax <- sec_axis(~ ., breaks = c(a = \"foo\", b = \"bar\"))\n  sc <- scale_x_discrete()\n  ax$init(sc)\n  expect_equal(ax$labels, c(\"a\", \"b\"))\n  expect_null(names(ax$breaks))\n})\n```\n\nNo other part of the secondary‑axis code needs to be touched: the labels\nare now in place before `break_info()` is ever called, and everything\ndown‑stream already works with an explicit character vector of labels.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n• one roxygen bullet explaining the behaviour  \n• six new lines in `AxisSecondary$init()` implementing the behaviour  \n• (optionally) a short regression test\n\nWith these changes, users can write e.g.\n\n```r\nscale_x_discrete(sec.axis = sec_axis(breaks = c(A = \"α\", B = \"β\")))\n```\n\nand get Greek letters on the secondary axis without having to repeat the\ninformation in a separate `labels` argument.",

Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\n**The submission** takes a different approach:\n- It adds a new code block after `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` that checks if the breaks have names and, if so, sets those names as labels.\n- It doesn't modify the `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` line.\n\nThe submission's approach addresses the underlying goal (using break names as labels) but doesn't implement the specific changes requested in the criterion. The criterion wants names to be explicitly preserved during operations, while the submission addresses the issue by directly setting the labels based on break names.\n\nWhile the submission might work functionally, it doesn't meet the specific implementation requested by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer meets the criterion, which suggests making two specific changes to the code to ensure that discrete breaks with names will be used as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specifies two exact changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in order to preserve names from the scale's breaks.\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to ensure that names are preserved after mapping.\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of ensuring names are preserved in the breaks themselves, it adds new code that checks if breaks have names, and then copies those names to labels. While this might achieve a similar result functionally, it:\n1. Doesn't make either of the two specific changes required by the criterion\n2. Adds more complex logic rather than making the simpler name-preserving changes specified\n3. Only checks for named breaks after other initialization, rather than ensuring names are preserved throughout the process\n\nThe submission's approach is a solution to the general problem, but it doesn't meet the specific criterion which specifies exactly what code changes should be made.\n\nGRADE: I",

Instead of ensuring names are preserved in the breaks themselves, it adds new code that checks if breaks have names, and then copies those names to labels. While this might achieve a similar result functionally, it:\n1. Doesn't make either of the two specific changes required by the criterion\n2.

          "explanation": "I'll analyze whether the submission meets the criterion by going through the required steps.\n\nThe criterion specifies three main steps:\n1. Keeping rows with > 100 flights per tailnum\n2. Summarizing to find proportion of NA arr_delay values\n3. Arranging in descending order to find the highest proportion\n\nThe submission:\n1. Groups by tailnum and calculates n_flights = n() and prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n2. Filters for n_flights >= 100\n3. Uses slice_max(prop_na) to get the highest proportion\n\nLet's compare to the criterion's approach:\n- The submission filters for !is.na(tailnum), which the criterion notes is acceptable\n- The submission correctly uses mean(is.na(arr_delay)) to calculate the proportion\n- The submission's approach differs in ordering - it first summarizes all tailnums, then filters for n_flights >= 100, rather than filtering first\n- It uses slice_max() rather than arrange(desc()), but this achieves the same result\n\nThe logic is correct, though the implementation differs slightly from the suggested approaches. The submission will correctly identify the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nGRADE: C",

Keeping rows with > 100 flights per tailnum\n2. Summarizing to find proportion of NA arr_delay values\n3. Arranging in descending order to find the highest proportion\n\nThe submission:\n1. Groups by tailnum and calculates n_flights = n() and prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n2. Filters for n_flights >= 100\n3. Uses slice_max(prop_na) to get the highest proportion\n\nLet's compare to the criterion's approach:\n- The submission filters for !is.na(tailnum), which the criterion notes is acceptable\n- The submission correctly uses mean(is.na(arr_delay)) to calculate the proportion\n- The submission's approach differs in ordering - it first summarizes all tailnums, then filters for n_flights >= 100, rather than filtering first\n- It uses slice_max() rather than arrange(desc()), but this achieves the same result\n\nThe logic is correct, though the implementation differs slightly from the suggested approaches. The submission will correctly identify the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nGRADE: C"

The submission doesn't use a grouped filter to only keep rows with > 100 flights. Instead, it first summarizes the data to get the count of flights per tailnum, then filters those summaries. This is a different approach than specified in the criterion, which wanted filtering at the row level first.\n\n2. The submission correctly calculates the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, which matches the criterion.\n\n3. The submission correctly arranges the results in descending order of the proportion of NAs.\n\n4. The submission correctly filters out NA tailnums, which the criterion mentions is acceptable.\n\nThe key difference is in step 1 - the submission uses a \"summarize then filter\" approach rather than the \"filter then summarize\" approach specified in the criterion. This is a different algorithm that will give the same result (since we're looking for tailnums with at least 100 flights), but it doesn't match the specific steps required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

The submission doesn't use a grouped filter to only keep rows with > 100 flights. Instead, it first summarizes the data to get the count of flights per tailnum, then filters those summaries. This is a different approach than specified in the criterion, which wanted filtering at the row level first.\n\n2. The submission correctly calculates the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, which matches the criterion.\n\n3. The submission correctly arranges the results in descending order of the proportion of NAs.\n\n4. The submission correctly filters out NA tailnums, which the criterion mentions is acceptable.\n\nThe key difference is in step 1 - the submission uses a \"summarize then filter\" approach rather than the \"filter then summarize\" approach specified in the criterion. This is a different algorithm that will give the same result (since we're looking for tailnums with at least 100 flights), but it doesn't match the specific steps required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

The submission correctly filters out NA tailnums, which the criterion mentions is acceptable.\n\nThe key difference is in step 1 - the submission uses a \"summarize then filter\" approach rather than the \"filter then summarize\" approach specified in the criterion. This is a different algorithm that will give the same result (since we're looking for tailnums with at least 100 flights), but it doesn't match the specific steps required in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission against the criterion.\n\nThe submission has the following steps:\n1. It starts by joining with the `planes` dataset using `semi_join(planes, by = \"tailnum\")`, which is unnecessary according to the criterion (which states \"The `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored\").\n2. It filters out rows with NA `tailnum`, which is acceptable as per the criterion.\n3. It groups by `tailnum` and then:\n   - Calculates `n_flights = n()` (counting flights per tailnum)\n   - Calculates `prop_NA_arr = mean(is.na(arr_delay))` (proportion of NA values for arr_delay)\n4. It filters for `n_flights >= 100`, which differs slightly from the criterion's approach (which suggests filtering for `n() > 100` at the group level).\n5. It arranges by `prop_NA_arr` in descending order and selects the top result.\n\nThe main differences from the suggested approach in the criterion are:\n1. The use of `semi_join` with the planes dataset\n2. The filtering of `n_flights >= 100` after summarization rather than filtering `n() > 100` at the group level before summarization\n3. The extra steps to extract just the tailnum value at the end\n\nHowever, the approach correctly:\n- Properly calculates the proportion of NA values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n- Correctly filters for planes with at least 100 flights\n- Arranges the results to find the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA values\n\nThese differences in implementation approach will likely yield the correct result, although the method is not exactly as described in the criterion. The core logic is sound, but it doesn't follow the specified three-step process precisely.\n\nGRADE: P",

Use the correct argument name (and make sure dplyr is up‑to‑date):\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)          # needs version 1.1.0 or later\n\ndf %>% \n  mutate(new_var = mean(value),          # whatever you want to calculate\n         .by = c(id, date))              # <- note the .by\n```\n\n2. If you can’t/won’t upgrade dplyr, do it the old way with `group_by()`:\n\n```r\ndf %>% \n  group_by(id, date) %>% \n  mutate(new_var = mean(value)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n```\n\nEither approach will remove the size‑mismatch error.",

The submission uses `attr(res, \"name\") <- as.character(name)[1L]` which adds extra processing (`as.character(name)[1L]`) that wasn't specified in the criterion\n2. The submission doesn't call `force(name)` before `check_dataset(dataset)`, which the criterion specifically mentions is needed to ensure the substitution works correctly\n3. The submission adds comments that weren't part of the original code\n\nThe functionality appears correct overall, but since it's missing the `force(name)` call which is explicitly required in the criterion, and it adds unexpected processing and comments, I would rate it as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

The solution is to remove the trailing comma\n\nThe submission clearly identifies the problematic trailing comma, explains why it causes the error, and provides multiple corrected code examples without the comma.\n\nThis directly and fully meets the criterion of identifying that \"There's a trailing comma after `.names = \"x\"` that needs to be removed.\"\n\nGRADE: C"

The function is there, but it is *not exported*, so the usual two–colon syntax cannot see it.\n\nWhat this means for a package you are writing\n\n1. CRAN (and most linters) expect you to use only **exported** objects from other\n   packages, or to reproduce the code yourself.  \n   Using an internal helper through the triple‑colon operator\n\n   ```r\n   dplyr:::closest()\n   ```\n\n   will work technically, but CRAN discourages this and the function may change\n   or disappear at any time without notice.\n\n2. Because `closest()` is not exported, you cannot silence the “no visible global function definition” note with\n\n   ```r\n   @importFrom dplyr closest\n   ```\n\n   — roxygen2 / R CMD check will complain that the symbol is not exported.\n\nHow to “fix” the problem\n\n• Preferably, do **not** rely on `dplyr`’s internal helper.  \n  Copy the (very small) source of the function into your own package, give it\n  your own name, and export it if you want users to call it directly.\n\n• If you insist on using the internal helper, call it with three colons\n  (`dplyr:::closest()`) and be prepared for possible breakage when `dplyr`\n  changes.  You must also tell R CMD check explicitly that you know you are\n  using an un‑exported symbol:\n\n  ```r\n  utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")\n  ```\n\n  (though this is still discouraged for CRAN submissions).\n\nBottom line: `closest()` is internal to `dplyr`; because it is not exported you\ncannot legally access it with `dplyr::closest()`.  Either re‑implement the tiny\nhelper in your own code or accept the risks of calling it with\n`dplyr:::closest()`."
