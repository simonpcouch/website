This changes the stacking to proportions, so that each bar has the same height (1) with segments proportional to clarity.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = \"fill\")\n```\n\nThis way, the heights will all be the same (proportion = 1), and the segments show the proportion of each clarity within each cut. If you want the *total height* of the bar to represent the proportion of diamonds with that cut (relative to all diamonds), and within each bar the segments represent clarity proportions **within that cut**, that's a bit more complex. You want:\n\n- Bar heights = proportion of cuts (sum to 1 across all cuts)\n\n- Within each bar, segments = proportion of clarity levels (sum to 1 within each bar)\n\nFor that, you need to preprocess the data to calculate proportions and plot with `geom_col()`.\n\nHere's how you can do this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Calculate proportions of each cut\ncut_props <- diamonds %>%\n  group_by(cut) %>%\n  summarise(cut_count = n()) %>%\n  mutate(cut_prop = cut_count / sum(cut_count))\n\n# Calculate clarity proportions within each cut\nclarity_props <- diamonds %>%\n  group_by(cut, clarity) %>%\n  summarise(count = n()) %>%\n  group_by(cut) %>%\n  mutate(clarity_prop = count / sum(count)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Combine cut proportions with clarity proportions\nplot_data <- clarity_props %>%\n  left_join(cut_props %>% select(cut, cut_prop), by = \"cut\") %>%\n  mutate(height = cut_prop * clarity_prop)\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = cut, y = height, fill = clarity)) +\n  geom_col()\n```\n\nThis code will produce bars with heights proportional to the *overall* frequency of cuts and segments showing clarity proportions within each cut.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- `position = \"fill\"` in `geom_bar` makes bars all height 1 with segments representing within-bar proportions.\n\n- For bars representing overall proportions of cut, and within-bar clarity proportions, use precomputed proportions and `geom_col()`.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate the submitted answer and compare it to the criterion to see if it correctly solves the problem.\n\nThe task is to set a flag where:\n1. Flag = 1 if either:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\" exists for an ID, OR\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n2. Flag = 0 otherwise\n\nLooking at the submission, there's a misinterpretation of the second criterion. The submission states:\n> - There exist two or more `Type_I` visits with dates at least 90 days apart (i.e., the difference between their dates is 90 days or more).\n\nThis is the opposite of the criterion in the task, which asks for Type_I visits within 90 days of one another, not at least 90 days apart.\n\nThe code in the submission also implements this misinterpreted logic:\n```r\nhas_type_I_90day_diff = {\n  dts <- type_I_dates\n  if(length(dts) < 2) {\n    FALSE\n  } else {\n    any(abs(outer(dts, dts, \"-\")) >= 90)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe solution is checking if any pair of Type_I dates differ by at least 90 days, but it should be checking if any pair differs by less than or equal to 90 days.\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of the requirement, leading to incorrect results for some IDs. The criterion solution correctly implements the logic with `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`.\n\nThe submission is comprehensive in its approach and explanation, but it misinterprets a key requirement, which would lead to incorrect flagging.\n\nGRADE: I",

Flag = 1 if either:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\" exists for an ID, OR\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n2. Flag = 0 otherwise\n\nLooking at the submission, there's a misinterpretation of the second criterion. The submission states:\n> - There exist two or more `Type_I` visits with dates at least 90 days apart (i.e., the difference between their dates is 90 days or more).\n\nThis is the opposite of the criterion in the task, which asks for Type_I visits within 90 days of one another, not at least 90 days apart.\n\nThe code in the submission also implements this misinterpreted logic:\n```r\nhas_type_I_90day_diff = {\n  dts <- type_I_dates\n  if(length(dts) < 2) {\n    FALSE\n  } else {\n    any(abs(outer(dts, dts, \"-\")) >= 90)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe solution is checking if any pair of Type_I dates differ by at least 90 days, but it should be checking if any pair differs by less than or equal to 90 days.\n\nThis is a fundamental misunderstanding of the requirement, leading to incorrect results for some IDs. The criterion solution correctly implements the logic with `any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)`.\n\nThe submission is comprehensive in its approach and explanation, but it misinterprets a key requirement, which would lead to incorrect flagging.\n\nGRADE: I"

Check if there's at least one `Type_II` per `ID`.\n2. Check if there are at least two `Type_I` visits at least 90 days apart.\n   - For each ID, get the dates of `Type_I`.\n   - Calculate all pairwise differences of dates.\n   - Check if any difference >= 90 days.\n3. Combine these two conditions into a flag.\n\n---\n\n### Code\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nresult <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    type_I_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n  ) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(\n    # For type_I_dates, calculate all pairwise absolute differences - if >= 90 exists\n    has_type_I_90day_diff = {\n      dts <- type_I_dates\n      if(length(dts) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        any(abs(outer(dts, dts, \"-\")) >= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | has_type_I_90day_diff)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `group_by(ID)` groups by ID.\n- `summarise()` creates two columns:\n  - `has_type_II`: is there any `Type_II` for this ID?\n  - `type_I_dates`: list of dates where type == `Type_I`.\n- Then `rowwise()` allows us to do per-row operations on the list-column.\n- Using `outer()` to compute the difference matrix of dates.\n- Check if any pair differs by at least 90 days.\n- Combine the conditions with OR.\n- Convert logical to integer (0/1) for the flag.\n\n---\n\n### Sample output on your example:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\nThis matches your desired output."

Check if there's at least one \"Type_II\".\n2. Check if there exist two or more \"Type_I\" visits where the difference in their dates is at least 90 days.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step approach using `dplyr` and `tidyr`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # Extract only Type_I visits and sort by date\n    type_I_dates = list(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Calculate pairwise differences between Type_I dates\n    type_I_flag = {\n      dates <- type_I_dates\n      # If fewer than 2 dates, can't satisfy condition\n      if (length(dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Calculate all pairwise differences of dates\n        diffs <- abs(outer(dates, dates, `-`))\n        # Check if any difference is >= 90 (ignoring the diagonal zeros)\n        any(diffs[lower.tri(diffs)] >= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_flag)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- For each `ID`, you check if there is any `\"Type_II\"`.\n- Extract `Type_I` dates and check pairwise date differences to find if any pair is at least 90 days apart.\n- Set the `Flag` as 1 if either condition is true, else 0.\n\n---\n\n### Output:\n\nApplying this to your data, you'll get:\n\n|ID      |Flag|\n|--------|----|\n|000000  |0   |\n|000001  |1   |\n|000002  |1   |\n|000003  |1   |\n|000004  |1   |\n|000005  |1   |\n|000006  |0   |\n\nThis matches your requested output.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a slightly more concise version using additional `tidyverse` functions like `combn`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    type_I_dates = list(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  rowwise() %>%\n  mutate(\n    type_I_flag = {\n      dates <- type_I_dates\n      if(length(dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        diffs <- combn(dates, 2, function(x) abs(diff(x)))\n        any(diffs >= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_II | type_I_flag)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\nFeel free to choose the form you prefer.",

Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot or a smoothed line.\n\nHere is a concrete approach using `dplyr` and `ggplot2`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Sort by date and departure time, since flights are across multiple days\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Create a lagged dep_delay column for the previous flight\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Remove rows where previous delay is NA (the very first flight)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by previous departure delay rounded to nearest integer for binning\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_rounded = round(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Summarize mean current departure delay for each previous delay bin\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            count = n()) %>%\n  # Optional: filter to bins with sufficient counts to avoid sparse data noise\n  filter(count > 10) %>%\n  # Plot mean current delay vs previous delay\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay_rounded, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n       y = \"Mean departure delay of current flight (minutes)\",\n       title = \"Mean departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Flights are sorted by datetime to define the sequence.\n- We use `lag(dep_delay)` to get the previous flight’s departure delay.\n- We round the lagged delay before grouping, to average delays in bins.\n- At the end, the scatter plot plus a smooth LOESS curve shows the trend.\n\nIf you want to restrict the preceding flight to those sharing some characteristic (e.g., same carrier, or same origin airport), you can add a `group_by(carrier)` or `group_by(origin)` before `arrange()` or just use `group_by(carrier)`, `arrange()`, and `mutate()` inside the group to get lag within carrier sequences. Here's a variant by carrier:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(carrier) %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_rounded = round(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            count = n()) %>%\n  filter(count > 10) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay_rounded, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n       y = \"Mean departure delay of current flight (minutes)\",\n       title = \"Mean departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay (by carrier)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis gives a clearer picture that respects the ordering within carriers.\n\nLet me know if you want to explore by other groupings!",
          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission based on the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key requirements:\n1. The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` airport (since delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at different airports)\n2. The mean departure delay should be calculated for each numeric value of the lagged departure delay\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nIn the first code example, the code arranges flights by date and time, but doesn't group by `origin` when creating the lagged values. This means it's looking at the sequence of all flights across all airports, which doesn't match the criterion's requirements.\n\nIn the second code example, the submission groups by `carrier` rather than `origin`, which again doesn't meet the criterion. The question is about temporal correlation at the same airport, not within the same airline.\n\nBoth examples correctly:\n- Calculate mean departure delay for each value of previous delay\n- Remove NA values\n- Visualize the relationship appropriately\n\nHowever, the fundamental issue is that the submission fails to group by `origin` when creating the lagged values, which is explicitly stated as necessary in the criterion. The submission shows good understanding of the lag function and visualization approach, but misses this critical aspect of the problem.\n\nGRADE: P",

The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` airport (since delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at different airports)\n2. The mean departure delay should be calculated for each numeric value of the lagged departure delay\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nIn the first code example, the code arranges flights by date and time, but doesn't group by `origin` when creating the lagged values. This means it's looking at the sequence of all flights across all airports, which doesn't match the criterion's requirements.\n\nIn the second code example, the submission groups by `carrier` rather than `origin`, which again doesn't meet the criterion. The question is about temporal correlation at the same airport, not within the same airline.\n\nBoth examples correctly:\n- Calculate mean departure delay for each value of previous delay\n- Remove NA values\n- Visualize the relationship appropriately\n\nHowever, the fundamental issue is that the submission fails to group by `origin` when creating the lagged values, which is explicitly stated as necessary in the criterion. The submission shows good understanding of the lag function and visualization approach, but misses this critical aspect of the problem.\n\nGRADE: P",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

Below is an example in R using **tidyverse** and **dplyr** that visualizes the mean departure delay (`dep_delay`) of a flight vs. the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight using `lag()`.\n\nWe will:\n\n1.

Group by the previous flight's dep_delay to calculate the mean current flight's dep_delay.\n4. Plot the result using `ggplot2`.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Arrange by time to keep flights in chronological order (by year, month, day, dep_time)\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Create a column for the previous flight's departure delay using lag()\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Remove the first row since it has no previous flight delay\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by the previous flight's delay (rounded for smoothing)\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_round = round(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_round) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # Plot: x = previous flight delay, y = mean current flight delay\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay_round, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The flights are first sorted chronologically.\n- `lag(dep_delay)` shifts the departure delays by 1 row, aligning each flight with the previous flight's delay.\n- We then round the previous delay so that we group flights by similar previous flight delay values.\n- Finally, the mean delay of current flights for each group of previous delays is calculated and plotted.\n- `geom_smooth()` adds a trend line to better visualize the correlation.\n\nLet me know if you want the plot grouped by carrier or for specific routes or days!"

Below is an example in R using **tidyverse** and **dplyr** that visualizes the mean departure delay (`dep_delay`) of a flight vs. the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight using `lag()`.\n\nWe will:\n\n1. Arrange the data by time to ensure the \"previous flight\" makes sense.\n2. Use `lag(dep_delay)` to get the departure delay of the previous flight.\n3. Group by the previous flight's dep_delay to calculate the mean current flight's dep_delay.\n4. Plot the result using `ggplot2`.\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  # Arrange by time to keep flights in chronological order (by year, month, day, dep_time)\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  # Create a column for the previous flight's departure delay using lag()\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Remove the first row since it has no previous flight delay\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # Group by the previous flight's delay (rounded for smoothing)\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_round = round(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_round) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # Plot: x = previous flight delay, y = mean current flight delay\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay_round, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The flights are first sorted chronologically.\n- `lag(dep_delay)` shifts the departure delays by 1 row, aligning each flight with the previous flight's delay.\n- We then round the previous delay so that we group flights by similar previous flight delay values.\n- Finally, the mean delay of current flights for each group of previous delays is calculated and plotted.\n- `geom_smooth()` adds a trend line to better visualize the correlation.\n\nLet me know if you want the plot grouped by carrier or for specific routes or days!",

According to the HTTP specification:\n\n- **GET requests should not have a body**.  \n- Many servers reject GET requests with bodies and respond with 405.\n\n### How to fix:\n\n1. **Change the method to POST, if the endpoint accepts POST** — usually endpoints expecting a JSON body use POST.\n\n2. **If it must be GET, you should pass data as query parameters, not in the body.**\n\n---\n\n### Solution 1: Use POST method\n\nModify your curl command like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\nAnd similarly change your `httr2` code:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"))\n\nres <- one2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\nNote: Use `req_method(\"POST\")` to specify POST.\n\n---\n\n### Solution 2: If GET must be used, add params in URL\n\nChange your curl command to:\n\n```bash\ncurl -G \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'id=5' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'fechaInicial=2023-02-01' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'fechaFinal=2023-05-01'\n```\n\nIn `httr2`:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )\n\nres <- one2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **GET** requests generally do not have a body → you need to send data as URL query parameters.\n- If your API expects JSON body, use **POST**.\n- The 405 error is likely caused because the server is rejecting the GET with a body.\n\nCheck your API docs to know the correct method to use (GET vs POST).

The submission does not point this out as an issue. In fact, it suggests changing to POST rather than keeping GET and adding the missing method specification.\n\nThe submission also has a mistake in the original code - it shows `cone2 %>% req_perform()` instead of `one2 %>% req_perform()` but doesn't address this.\n\nSince the submission doesn't identify the specific missing `req_method(\"GET\")` as stated in the criterion, but instead recommends changing to POST (which might be the correct solution but doesn't match the criterion), the answer is incorrect according to this specific criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

According to HTTP spec, servers usually ignore the body of GET requests and may reject such requests.\n- If the endpoint expects you to send data (like id, fechaInicial, fechaFinal), it's usually expecting a **POST** or **PUT** request, not GET.\n- Some servers might allow JSON query parameters or URL parameters for GET, but not a request body with JSON.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix:\n\n1. **Check the API documentation.**\n\n   - If the API expects data in the request body, confirm whether the HTTP method should be **POST** or **PUT**, not GET.\n   - If the API expects the data as query parameters, then you should move your parameters into the URL instead.\n\n2. **If the API expects POST instead of GET with JSON body:**\n\nModify your `curl` command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n    \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n  }'\n```\n\nNote: Change `-X 'GET'` to `-X POST` (or `PUT`, as per your API spec).\n\n3. **If the API expects data as query parameters over GET:**\n\nRewrite your request like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\nRemove the `-d` option because GET shouldn't have a body.\n\n---\n\n### For your R code (httr2):\n\n- If the method is GET with query params, use `req_url_query()` instead of `req_body_json()`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n- If the method needs to be POST with JSON body:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(\n      id = 5,\n      fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n      fechaFinal = \"2023-05-01\"\n    )\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Do not send body data with GET requests.**\n- Use POST if you want to send JSON in the request body.\n- Or send the parameters in the URL if it's really GET.\n\nFixing your curl and httr2 code by changing the method and/or parameters placement should solve the HTTP 405 error."

The key point in your `curl` is that you are sending JSON data (`-d`), which normally implies a payload in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, but your method is `GET`.\n\n### Explanation:\n- `GET` requests **should not** have a body (payload). According to HTTP spec, servers usually ignore the body of GET requests and may reject such requests.\n- If the endpoint expects you to send data (like id, fechaInicial, fechaFinal), it's usually expecting a **POST** or **PUT** request, not GET.\n- Some servers might allow JSON query parameters or URL parameters for GET, but not a request body with JSON.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix:\n\n1. **Check the API documentation.**\n\n   - If the API expects data in the request body, confirm whether the HTTP method should be **POST** or **PUT**, not GET.\n   - If the API expects the data as query parameters, then you should move your parameters into the URL instead.\n\n2. **If the API expects POST instead of GET with JSON body:**\n\nModify your `curl` command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n    \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n  }'\n```\n\nNote: Change `-X 'GET'` to `-X POST` (or `PUT`, as per your API spec).\n\n3. **If the API expects data as query parameters over GET:**\n\nRewrite your request like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\nRemove the `-d` option because GET shouldn't have a body.\n\n---\n\n### For your R code (httr2):\n\n- If the method is GET with query params, use `req_url_query()` instead of `req_body_json()`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"GET\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n- If the method needs to be POST with JSON body:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(\n      id = 5,\n      fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n      fechaFinal = \"2023-05-01\"\n    )\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Do not send body data with GET requests.**\n- Use POST if you want to send JSON in the request body.\n- Or send the parameters in the URL if it's really GET.\n\nFixing your curl and httr2 code by changing the method and/or parameters placement should solve the HTTP 405 error."

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: Great question! When a factor level is unused in your data (i.e., there are no points mapped to that level), **ggplot2** includes that level in the legend (because of `drop = FALSE`) but doesn't have any geom to draw—a blank spot shows up.\n\nTo show a colored dot for that unused level in the legend, you need to \"trick\" ggplot2 into drawing a point for that level without placing any visible points in the plot area for it.\n\n### Solution: Add an invisible point with zero alpha at a missing coordinate for the unused level\n\nYou can add a dummy row with `z = \"d\"` but with `NA` values (or values outside the plot range) and set the point's alpha to 0. This point won't show in the plot, but it will cause ggplot2 to draw its legend key with a colored dot.\n\nHere’s how you can do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Original data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for the unused factor level 'd'\ndf2 <- rbind(df,\n             data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +\n  # Optionally, remove NA points from plot area\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")\n```\n\n**What this does:**\n\n- The extra row with `x = NA` and `y = NA` for `z = \"d\"` is invisible in the plot (no point appears), but it triggers the drawing of the legend key symbol.\n- `drop = FALSE` keeps the level \"d\" in the legend.\n- `override.aes = list(alpha = 1)` in `guide_legend()` ensures the legend key is fully visible (sometimes alpha is inherited and could make the symbol faint).\n- `coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")` is optional and useful if your points are clipped by the plot panel.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Use `override.aes` to force the legend key appearance\n\nIf you want to avoid manipulating the data, a cleaner method is to use `override.aes` inside `guide_legend()` to force **all** legend keys to appear as points with specified properties regardless of whether those points appear in the plot:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3, alpha = 1)))\n```\n\nThis way, ggplot draws all legend keys as solid dots in the corresponding color.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: Either add a dummy row for the missing level or use `override.aes` in `guide_legend()` to control the legend symbols. Both will show a green dot next to \"d\" in the legend.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

                  "text": "Great question! When a factor level is unused in your data (i.e., there are no points mapped to that level), **ggplot2** includes that level in the legend (because of `drop = FALSE`) but doesn't have any geom to draw—a blank spot shows up.\n\nTo show a colored dot for that unused level in the legend, you need to \"trick\" ggplot2 into drawing a point for that level without placing any visible points in the plot area for it.\n\n### Solution: Add an invisible point with zero alpha at a missing coordinate for the unused level\n\nYou can add a dummy row with `z = \"d\"` but with `NA` values (or values outside the plot range) and set the point's alpha to 0. This point won't show in the plot, but it will cause ggplot2 to draw its legend key with a colored dot.\n\nHere’s how you can do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Original data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for the unused factor level 'd'\ndf2 <- rbind(df,\n             data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1))) +\n  # Optionally, remove NA points from plot area\n  coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")\n```\n\n**What this does:**\n\n- The extra row with `x = NA` and `y = NA` for `z = \"d\"` is invisible in the plot (no point appears), but it triggers the drawing of the legend key symbol.\n- `drop = FALSE` keeps the level \"d\" in the legend.\n- `override.aes = list(alpha = 1)` in `guide_legend()` ensures the legend key is fully visible (sometimes alpha is inherited and could make the symbol faint).\n- `coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")` is optional and useful if your points are clipped by the plot panel.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Use `override.aes` to force the legend key appearance\n\nIf you want to avoid manipulating the data, a cleaner method is to use `override.aes` inside `guide_legend()` to force **all** legend keys to appear as points with specified properties regardless of whether those points appear in the plot:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3, alpha = 1)))\n```\n\nThis way, ggplot draws all legend keys as solid dots in the corresponding color.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: Either add a dummy row for the missing level or use `override.aes` in `guide_legend()` to control the legend symbols. Both will show a green dot next to \"d\" in the legend.",

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: Great question! You've made a plot where the factor `z` has 4 levels (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`), but your data only uses the first 3 levels (`a`, `b`, `c`). Your legend correctly includes \"d\" because of `drop = FALSE` in `scale_color_manual()`, but the legend symbol for \"d\" is blank because no points with that value exist in the plot.\n\n**To get green dots next to all the legend entries, including `\"d\"` which has no points in the data, you can add dummy points (or an invisible layer) that include all factor levels.** Here's how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n### Approach 1: Add dummy points with all factor levels but make them invisible on the plot\n\nAdd an extra layer with points for all factor levels at some location (e.g., outside the plotting area or with zero size to make them invisible), so ggplot adds those points to the legend with the color dots.\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Dummy dataframe with all levels, placed somewhere outside plot area\ndf_all_levels <- data.frame(\n  x = rep(NA, 4),  # position doesn't matter but must exist\n  y = rep(NA, 4),\n  z = factor(letters[1:4], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(data = df_all_levels, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), alpha = 0) +  # invisible points to include legend entries\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n- `alpha = 0` makes these dummy points completely transparent (invisible) on the plot.\n- Since these are points with factor level `\"d\"`, ggplot2 contains those in the legend with their color symbol (green dot).\n- Legend will now have the dot for `\"d\"` in green.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Add dummy points outside plotting range\n\nAlternatively, add dummy points *slightly off-plot* but visible, then use `expand_limits()` to keep plot range sane or use `coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")` if you don't want the dummy points visible.\n\nBut usually Approach 1 is simpler.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n- `drop = FALSE` inside `scale_color_manual()` ensures unused factor levels remain in the legend.\n- Legend keys appear only if there is some geom that references the corresponding aesthetic with that factor level.\n- Dummy points trick forces ggplot2 to recognize the unused factor level as part of the legend and draws the symbol.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want the dummy points totally visible or in some custom legend style!\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Your legend correctly includes \"d\" because of `drop = FALSE` in `scale_color_manual()`, but the legend symbol for \"d\" is blank because no points with that value exist in the plot.\n\n**To get green dots next to all the legend entries, including `\"d\"` which has no points in the data, you can add dummy points (or an invisible layer) that include all factor levels.** Here's how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n### Approach 1: Add dummy points with all factor levels but make them invisible on the plot\n\nAdd an extra layer with points for all factor levels at some location (e.g., outside the plotting area or with zero size to make them invisible), so ggplot adds those points to the legend with the color dots.\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Dummy dataframe with all levels, placed somewhere outside plot area\ndf_all_levels <- data.frame(\n  x = rep(NA, 4),  # position doesn't matter but must exist\n  y = rep(NA, 4),\n  z = factor(letters[1:4], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point(data = df_all_levels, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), alpha = 0) +  # invisible points to include legend entries\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n- `alpha = 0` makes these dummy points completely transparent (invisible) on the plot.\n- Since these are points with factor level `\"d\"`, ggplot2 contains those in the legend with their color symbol (green dot).\n- Legend will now have the dot for `\"d\"` in green.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Add dummy points outside plotting range\n\nAlternatively, add dummy points *slightly off-plot* but visible, then use `expand_limits()` to keep plot range sane or use `coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")` if you don't want the dummy points visible.\n\nBut usually Approach 1 is simpler.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n- `drop = FALSE` inside `scale_color_manual()` ensures unused factor levels remain in the legend.\n- Legend keys appear only if there is some geom that references the corresponding aesthetic with that factor level.\n- Dummy points trick forces ggplot2 to recognize the unused factor level as part of the legend and draws the symbol.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want the dummy points totally visible or in some custom legend style!",

Your code correctly keeps the unused factor level `\"d\"` in the legend, but **since no data points have the level `\"d\"`**, no green dot is drawn next to it in the legend. The legend items by default only show symbols for levels actually present in the plotted data.\n\n### How to get a green dot next to \"d\" in the legend?\n\nYou need to use the `guide_legend()` with the argument `override.aes`, which lets you manually specify the appearance of legend keys regardless of whether observed data points exist for that level.\n\nHere is how you can modify your `ggplot` code to **show a green dot for \"d\" in the legend, even though there are no points with this level in the data**:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\"),\n    guide = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(\n        shape = 16,                 # solid circle glyph\n        size = 3,                   # legend dot size\n        color = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"green\")  # colors for all levels including \"d\"\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `drop = FALSE` keeps unused factor levels in the legend.\n- `guide_legend()` with `override.aes` overrides the default appearance of the legend keys.\n- `shape = 16` is a solid circle (default point shape).\n- `size = 3` makes dots a good visual size in the legend.\n- `color = c(...)` manually sets the color of dots for **all legend entries**, including the unused `\"d\"` level.\n\nThis way, the legend will show a green dot next to `\"d\"`, even though no green data points are plotted.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Force a dummy point for \"d\"\n\nIf you want the legend icons to reflect the actual data, another approach is to add a single dummy observation for `level = \"d\"` somewhere out of range or make it transparent, but overriding the legend aes is cleaner and easier.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The answer explains:\n\n1. The problem: \"Your `address` string contains spaces and a comma\" that aren't properly encoded in the URL\n2. The solution: Using `URLencode()` to encode the address string\n3. Provides a complete code example showing how to properly encode the address:\n   ```r\n   address_enc <- URLencode(address)\n   url <- glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address_enc}&api_key={api_key}\")\n   ```\n\nThe submission also suggests an alternative approach using `httr2::req_url_query()` which handles the encoding automatically. Both approaches directly address the criterion of properly formatting the address for a valid URL.\n\nThe answer is thorough and correct. It explicitly demonstrates the use of `URLencode()` as mentioned in the criterion, and explains why this is necessary.\n\nGRADE: C"

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to assess if the submitted answer meets the criterion for how discrete breaks with names should be handled in secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes:\n\n1. In the `init()` method, change:\n```r\nif (scale$is_discrete()) {\n  self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n}\n```\nto:\n```r\nif (scale$is_discrete()) {\n  self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n}\n```\n\n2.

Instead, it proposes a complex modification to the `init()` method that checks for named breaks and uses those names as labels. However, this approach is not what the criterion specifies. \n\nThe criterion's approach is more direct - it ensures names are properly preserved through the `setNames()` function at two critical points in the code. The submitted solution takes a different approach by checking for names after the fact and applying them to labels.\n\nWhile the submission attempts to solve the problem of using named breaks as labels, it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submitted answer meets the criterion provided.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific code changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of making these specific changes, it proposes a more complex solution that:\n- Adds a new block of code to handle discrete scales separately\n- Checks for named breaks and sets labels to those names if present\n- Otherwise falls back to scale labels or waiver\n\nWhile the submission's approach might work for the general goal (using break names as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion is looking for very specific, minimal changes to preserve names when working with discrete scales.\n\nThe submission is an alternative solution that doesn't match what the criterion specifies.

The criterion is looking for very specific, minimal changes to preserve names when working with discrete scales.\n\nThe submission is an alternative solution that doesn't match what the criterion specifies.

Currently, when the secondary axis is discrete, it sets `self$breaks` but does not assign `self$labels` if labels are not provided or derived.\n\nThe natural way to handle this is:\n- If `self$labels` is derived (i.e., it inherits from primary axis), and if the breaks are discrete with names, then the labels should default to those break names.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n1.

Group the `flights` dataset by `tailnum`.\n2. Compute the number of flights and the number of `NA` values in `arr_delay`.\n3. Calculate the proportion of `NA`s.\n4. Filter to only tailnums with at least 100 flights.\n5. Arrange by descending proportion and pick the top result.\n\nHere's the tidyverse code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = na_arr_delay / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice_head(n = 1)\n```\n\nThis will give you the tailnum that meets the criteria.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for finding the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay` values among those with at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion outlines a specific three-step approach:\n1. Grouped filter to keep only tailnums with more than 100 flights\n2. Grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA `arr_delay` values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arrange results in descending order\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    n_na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = n_na_arr_delay / n_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n```\n\nThe submission takes a different approach:\n- It first groups by tailnum and calculates the number of flights and proportion of NAs\n- It then filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- It arranges by proportion and takes the top result\n\nThis approach differs from the criterion in that it doesn't perform the filtering step first. Instead of filtering within groups as specified in the criterion, it summarizes first and then filters. Additionally, it calculates the proportion using `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n_flights` rather than `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, though these are mathematically equivalent.\n\nWhile the submission would yield the correct result, it doesn't follow the specified approach in the criterion, particularly in terms of the order of operations.\n\nGRADE: P",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate the submitted answer against the criterion for finding the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion specifies that the solution should involve:\n1. A grouped filter to only keep rows with tailnums that have > 100 flights\n2. A grouped summarize to calculate the proportion of NA arr_delays using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n3. Arranging by the resulting column in descending order\n\nThe submitted solution:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_flights = n(),\n    n_na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = n_na_arr_delay / n_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1)\n```\n\nThis solution takes a different approach than what's specified in the criterion:\n- It first summarizes all flights by tailnum to count the total flights\n- Then it filters to keep only those with ≥ 100 flights\n- It calculates the proportion using `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n()` instead of `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n- It returns only the top result with `slice(1)`\n\nWhile this solution produces the correct answer, it doesn't follow the specific approach outlined in the criterion. The filtering happens after summarization rather than as a grouped filter first. Also, it uses `sum()/n()` rather than `mean()` to calculate the proportion (though mathematically equivalent).\n\nMoreover, the criterion specifically states that no persistent summarization should happen during the filtering step, but this solution summarizes first, then filters.\n\nGRADE: P",

Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The filtering happens after summarization rather than as a grouped filter first. Also, it uses `sum()/n()` rather than `mean()` to calculate the proportion (though mathematically equivalent).\n\nMoreover, the criterion specifically states that no persistent summarization should happen during the filtering step, but this solution summarizes first, then filters.\n\nGRADE: P"

It's a parameter used in functions like `merge()` or `join()` functions (e.g., `left_join()`, `inner_join()`) to specify columns to join by.\n- In `mutate()`, if you want to operate on groups of rows defined by some columns (e.g., `id`, `date`), you typically use `group_by(id, date)` before `mutate()`.\n- Passing `by` to `mutate()` causes R to think you are creating a new column named `by` with length that does not match the number of rows, which leads to this length mismatch error.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix it?\n\nIf you want to create or modify columns **group-wise**, do this:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # your calculations here, e.g.,\n    new_col = sum(some_column)\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\n### Example:\n\nSuppose you want to sum `value` within each `id` and `date` group:\n\n```r\ndf <- df %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(sum_value = sum(value)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Do NOT include `by = c(...)` inside `mutate()`.**\n- Use `group_by(id, date)` before `mutate()` if you want to perform grouped calculations.\n- Use `left_join()` or similar joins with `by` if you want to join two datasets by specific columns.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide your actual code snippet, I can help you adjust it precisely.",

This means no vertical jitter, only horizontal jitter.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Example data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = rep(1:3, each = 10),\n  y = rnorm(30)\n)\n\n# Plot with jitter only in the x direction\nggplot(df, aes(x = factor(x), y = y)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)` jitters points along the x-axis by up to ±0.2 units.\n- `height = 0` ensures no vertical jitter, so y values remain unchanged.\n- Using `factor(x)` on the x aesthetic makes x discrete so jittering is visually meaningful when the x variable is categorical or discrete.\n\nThis approach preserves the original y values while jittering horizontally to reduce overplotting.",

This prevents any jittering in the y-direction but applies jitter in the x-direction.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Sample data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = rep(1:3, each = 10),\n  y = rnorm(30)\n)\n\n# Plot with jitter only on x-axis\nggplot(df, aes(x = factor(x), y = y)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)` jitters points by up to 0.2 units along the x-axis.\n- Setting `height = 0` keeps the y-values unchanged.\n\nIf you want more control, adjust `width` to control the amount of jitter along x, and leave `height` at zero.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Using `geom_jitter()` with `height = 0`\nSince `geom_jitter()` is a shortcut for `geom_point(position = position_jitter())`, you can do:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = factor(x), y = y)) +\n  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis is simpler and does the same thing.",

                  "text": "The issue you're encountering is because the default value for the `name` parameter is evaluated at the time the function is *defined*, not at the time the function is called. Specifically, here:\n\n```r\nname = deparse(substitute(dataset))\n```\n\n`substitute(dataset)` is evaluated immediately at function definition, not inside the function body, so `dataset` is unavailable there and the default evaluated expression doesn't do what you want.\n\n### How to fix it\n\nYou want to **delay evaluation** of the default argument `name` to inside the function body, where `dataset` actually exists as an argument symbol.\n\nThe cleanest way is to use `missing()` and set the default inside the function body.\n\nHere is how you can rewrite your function:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  \n  # rest of your function here\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- When you call `task_create(simple_addition)` without specifying `name`, `name` is `NULL`.\n- Inside the function, detecting that `name` is `NULL`, you assign `name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))`.\n- `substitute(dataset)` inside the function body captures the symbol `simple_addition` as you want.\n- `deparse()` converts it to a string `\"simple_addition\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Complete minimal example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tibble)\n\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = NULL) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  \n  print(name)\n  # Do stuff with dataset and name...\n}\n\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n# [1] \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\nThis works exactly as you want.\n\n---\n\n### Why your original approach didn't work:\n\nDefaults like `name = deparse(substitute(dataset))` are evaluated once, at function creation time, and not each time the function is called. But `dataset` is only defined as an argument when the function is called, so `substitute(dataset)` in the default value context doesn't capture the symbol from the call.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a solution using more advanced methods like quosures or tidy evaluation!",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly identifies that using `session$ns` instead of `NS(id)` is the key to fixing the nested module namespace issue.\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, the author correctly identifies that there's a namespace issue, but their solution is different from what the criterion specifies. Instead of recommending to use `session$ns`, they suggest removing the namespace function entirely from the output IDs inside the `renderUI` function:\n\n```r\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n    verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n    plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThe submission explains that the namespace is already applied because the UI is being generated inside a module server function, so adding `ns()` again would double-namespace the IDs. While this approach might work in some cases, it does not address the specific criterion which states that `session$ns` should be used instead of `NS(id)` to maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules.\n\nThe submission completely misses mentioning `session$ns` as the proper solution, which is the key point in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

Instead use:\n\n```r\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n    verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n    plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n  )\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full fixed inner module server:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n        plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation why that works\n\n- `output$someTextGenerated`, `output$theChart` internally are namespaced by Shiny because they are created inside `moduleServer`.\n- The UI elements inside `renderUI` must reference the output by their *un-prefixed* IDs (e.g. `\"someTextGenerated\"`), because the entire `renderUI` content is already in the namespace of the module.\n\nConversely, if you were writing **static UI outside renderUI** in the module UI function - you would use `ns(\"someTextGenerated\")` to correctly prefix the ids for that module.\n\n---\n\n### Other notes\n\nYour app then works as expected: each inner module block generates a header, verbatim text, and a plot, fully namespaced.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to, I can provide a fully fixed code snippet with your entire example. Let me know!\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Instead of recommending to use `session$ns`, they suggest removing the namespace function entirely from the output IDs inside the `renderUI` function:\n\n```r\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n    verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n    plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThe submission explains that the namespace is already applied because the UI is being generated inside a module server function, so adding `ns()` again would double-namespace the IDs.

Instead use:\n\n```r\noutput$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n  tagList(\n    h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n    verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n    plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n  )\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full fixed inner module server:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n        plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation why that works\n\n- `output$someTextGenerated`, `output$theChart` internally are namespaced by Shiny because they are created inside `moduleServer`.\n- The UI elements inside `renderUI` must reference the output by their *un-prefixed* IDs (e.g. `\"someTextGenerated\"`), because the entire `renderUI` content is already in the namespace of the module.\n\nConversely, if you were writing **static UI outside renderUI** in the module UI function - you would use `ns(\"someTextGenerated\")` to correctly prefix the ids for that module.\n\n---\n\n### Other notes\n\nYour app then works as expected: each inner module block generates a header, verbatim text, and a plot, fully namespaced.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to, I can provide a fully fixed code snippet with your entire example.

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion focusing on the namespace issue in Shiny modules.\n\nThe criterion specifically states that the issue is about using `NS(id)` versus `session$ns` within modules, explaining that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain hierarchical relationships properly.\n\nLooking at the submission, it correctly identifies the namespace issue but provides a slightly different solution than what the criterion specifies. The submission suggests:\n\n1. Using `session$ns` instead of `ns` (derived from `NS(id)`) within the `renderUI()` function\n2. Keeping the existing `ns <- NS(id)` line in the module server function\n\nWhile the criterion specifically suggests:\n- Replacing `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns` in the module server function\n\nBoth approaches would work in practice to fix the namespacing issue, but the submission doesn't exactly match the specific implementation suggested in the criterion. \n\nThe submission's approach (keeping `ns <- NS(id)` but using `session$ns` in the `renderUI()`) is technically valid but doesn't fully align with the criterion's specific suggestion to replace `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns`.\n\nGRADE: P",

When you build UI for `renderUI()`, you should use `session$ns(\"id\")` to get the correct namespaced ID for elements inside the dynamically generated UI.\n\n---\n\n### The minimal fix:\n\nChange:\n\n```r\ntagList(\n  h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n  verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n  plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n)\n```\n\nto:\n\n```r\ntagList(\n  h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n  verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n  plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full fixed `innerServer` code:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # ns <- NS(id)   # redundant, use session$ns if needed\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n\n  })\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n\n- `session$ns(...)` returns the proper namespaced ID for the current module.\n- The output IDs in `output$` objects **are NOT further namespaced**. They belong to the current module environment.\n- The UI IDs inside `renderUI()` need to be consistent with those `outputIDs`. Using `session$ns()` ensures the correct ID mapping.\n- Using `ns()` (from `NS(id)`) duplicates the prefix, breaking the binding.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus: Clean up your `inner_UI`\n\nThe `inner_UI` function already includes:\n\n```r\nverbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n```\n\nThis will render \"something\" (output$someText) outside of the generated UI. The \"something Generated\" and the plot will appear inside the generated UI rendered by `output$theGeneratedUI`.\n\nThis setup should now work perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### Complete working example with fix:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\nWith this fix, your dynamically generated UI inside the module will properly render the verbatimTextOutput and the plot!\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules.

It explains that the Imports field needs the actual package name while the Remotes field specifies where to find the package.\n\nHowever, the submission misses the specific criterion being assessed. The solution it proposes is to change the package name in the Imports field to match what's in the remote repository's DESCRIPTION file. While this could work in some cases, it doesn't address the specific solution required by the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifically states that the user needs to use a `<package>=` prefix in the Remotes field. For example, instead of:\n```\nRemotes:\n org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThe correct format should be:\n```\nRemotes:\n spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis explicit package name prefix tells R that the package referred to as \"spatialstuff\" in the Imports field should be fetched from the \"org/spatial-Stuff\" GitHub repository. The submission doesn't mention this specific syntax at all, so it fails to address the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

                  "text": "The error comes from a mismatch between the **package name** used in your `DESCRIPTION` file and the **GitHub repository name** listed under `Remotes`.\n\n### Key points:\n\n1. **DESCRIPTION: Imports and Remotes fields**\n   - The `Imports:` field must list the **package name** exactly as it appears in the package that is installed (i.e., its `DESCRIPTION` name field).\n   - The `Remotes:` field specifies where to find the **source** repository for that package if it's not on CRAN.\n   - The GitHub repo name **does not need to match the package name**, but the package name in Imports and the package name in the remote GitHub repo must be consistent.\n\n2. **Your case:**\n\n```r\nImports:\n spatialstuff\nRemotes:\n org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n- Your package imports `spatialstuff` (lowercase, no dash).\n- The remote repo is at `org/spatial-Stuff` (mixed case, with a dash).\n- The remote repo's **package name inside the DESCRIPTION might be `spatialstuff` (which is okay)** or `spatial-Stuff` (difference in case or dashes).\n\n### Why does it fail?\n\n- The **error** says: Can't find package called `spatialstuff`.\n- This suggests that the package manager (pak) tried to install the GitHub remote `org/spatial-Stuff`, but inside that repo the **DESCRIPTION probably registers the package with a **different name** (e.g. `spatial-Stuff`), or the capitalization differs, or it uses underscores**, so the package manager can't resolve `spatialstuff`.\n- The package installation depends on matching the **package name** between Imports and the **installed package NAME in the DESCRIPTION of the remote repo**.\n\n### What to check / fix:\n\n1. Go to the repo `org/spatial-Stuff` and check its `DESCRIPTION` file:\n   - What is the `Package:` field there? Suppose it is `spatial-Stuff` or `spatialStuff`.\n   - The package name here must match what you put in `Imports:` exactly (same spelling and case).\n   \n2. Adjust your `Imports:` to the exact package name as defined in that remote repo's DESCRIPTION.\n   \n3. Keep `Remotes:` as `org/spatial-Stuff` because it points to the installation source.\n\nFor example, if the remote repo DESCRIPTION has:\n\n```r\nPackage: spatialStuff\n```\n\nThen in your package DESCRIPTION:\n\n```r\nImports:\n spatialStuff\nRemotes:\n org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n(Adjust capitalization exactly.)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes\n\n- GitHub repo names can contain dashes and uppercase letters freely, but R package names are usually lowercase and without dashes (`-` is not allowed in package names, underscores `_` are allowed sometimes, but dashes `-` are not valid in R package names).\n- The **package name** (in DESCRIPTION) should be a valid R package name (letters, numbers, dot, underscore), never a dash.\n- Often repos have different names (with dashes) and packages inside have different names (with no dashes).\n- You **cannot** have a package named `spatial-stuff` (with `-` dash), but the repo can be `spatial-Stuff`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- Check the **package name** in the remote repo's DESCRIPTION.\n- Use that exact name in `Imports`.\n- Keep the `Remotes:` line as is pointing to GitHub.\n- Then pkgdown / pak will resolve and install the dependency.\n\n---\n\n### Example fix\n\nSuppose remote DESCRIPTION says\n\n```r\nPackage: spatialStuff\nTitle: ...\n```\n\nChange your DESCRIPTION to\n\n```r\nImports:\n spatialStuff\nRemotes:\n org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nand retry.\n\n---\n\nIf you still have issues, please share the exact package name from that remote DESCRIPTION.",

It does **not** rename the package — the package name is defined **inside the package's DESCRIPTION file** (field `Package:`).\n\n- The `Remotes:` field expects syntax like: `user/repo`, where `repo` is the name of the GitHub repo.\n- The `Imports:` field expects the **package name** — which must match the `Package:` field **inside** the dependency.\n\nWhen you specify `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff`, the tooling tries to install the GitHub repo `spatial-Stuff` from org `org`.\n\nBut the package's `DESCRIPTION` inside that repo sets the package name to `spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n### Why the error?\n\n- The dependency resolver gets confused by a mismatch or by case differences.\n- The error says `Can't find package called spatialstuff` because when installing from the GitHub `spatial-Stuff` repo, the case-sensitive package name inside the DESCRIPTION is `spatialstuff`, but sometimes tools have problems matching these when the remotes repo name and package name casing differ.\n- Case sensitivity is tricky, especially on some filesystems, or in databases of package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### What is user error here? What to do?\n\n1. **Ensure that the package name inside the dependency DESCRIPTION exactly matches** what you put in `Imports:` (including case).\n\n2. **Ensure that your `Remotes:` entry points to the GitHub repo that truly contains the expected package.**\n\nYour current `Remotes:` looks fine if the repo is really called `spatial-Stuff`. However, because `spatialstuff` differs from `spatial-Stuff` in case and hyphen usage, remotes resolution may have trouble.\n\n---\n\n### A minimal test:\n\n- Try installing manually outside your pkgdown workflow:\n\n  ```r\n  remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n  ```\n\n  Does this work and install `spatialstuff`?\n\n- If yes, your remotes syntax is okay but pkgdown/pak might have trouble with the capitalization.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix:\n\n- **Use an explicit syntax in Remotes with the `::` to specify package name?**\n\n  Unfortunately `Remotes` does not support package rename mappings.\n\n- **Pin the remotes repo name exactly as it is:**\n\n  Your current remotes is aligned.\n\n- **Specify dependency in Imports with exact package name (probably `spatialstuff` all lowercase).**\n\n- **Check for case sensitivity issues in your CI environment.**\n\n---\n\n### A common workaround:\n\n1. Add this to your DESCRIPTION (usually already done):\n\n    ```\n    Imports:\n      spatialstuff\n    Remotes:\n      org/spatial-Stuff\n    ```\n\n2. In your CI workflow, **install remotes first and then install your package**, or explicitly run a step to install the GitHub dependency before pkgdown runs, e.g.:\n\n   ```r\n   remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n\n3. If pkgdown fails during dependency installation, consider:\n\n   - Adding a custom setup step in GitHub Actions workflow to install dependencies first.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- This is **not an error with the package itself but a tooling mismatch or environment problem**.\n- The remotes entry points to GitHub repo name (`spatial-Stuff`), but the package name is `spatialstuff`.\n- `Imports:` uses the *package name* which should match exactly the package DESCRIPTION in the dependency.\n- pkgdown or pak sometimes struggle with name case or hyphens in GitHub repo names when resolving dependencies.\n- Solution: \n  - Confirm manual installation of the remote package works,\n  - Add explicit install steps in CI to install dependency before pkgdown,\n  - Double-check that `Imports:` uses the exact package name.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to look at your full GitHub Actions workflow or pkgdown logs, please share them and I can help debug further."

Avoid dynamically creating methods in `initialize`.**  \nDefine `foo` directly as a public method in `Parent`:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n```\n\nThis way, the method `foo` exists at the class level, and `Child` can override and call `super$foo()` safely.\n\n---\n\n**2. If you *must* dynamically define methods in `initialize`, avoid overwriting or locking them before subclass overrides.**\n\nBut this is tricky and not recommended. The best practice is to define all methods at the class declaration time.\n\n---\n\n### Revised example\n\n```r\nlibrary(R6)\n\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print('child foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# Output:\n# [1] \"foo\"\n# [1] \"child foo\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Do not dynamically define methods inside `initialize`** if you want to override them safely in subclasses.\n- Instead, define all methods upfront in the class generator.\n- `lock_objects = FALSE` helps but does not override locked bindings from dynamically created methods.\n  \nBy defining `foo` directly in `Parent`'s public list, R6 can correctly manage the inheritance and method overriding.\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The problem is that this `chat` is the argument itself — it tries to use its own value in its default, which is illegal and causes the recursive promise evaluation error.\n\nEssentially, the interpreter sees:\n\n- argument `chat` has default `chat` → to resolve `chat` default, it needs `chat` → infinite recursion.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix\n\nYou want the inner function's `chat` default to be the outer function's argument `chat`. However, both have the same name `chat`, so in the inner function parameter list, `chat` shadows the outer `chat`.

This kind of default (\"default refers to another argument of a parent function\") is tricky in R because default argument expressions are lazily evaluated and tied to their own environment. When the inner function is created, it creates a closure; however, because `chat` in the inner function’s signature shadows the outer `chat`, `chat = chat` ends up referring to itself recursively causing the error.\n\n---\n\n## How to fix it?\n\n### Solution 1: Remove the default in the inner function and rely on lexical scoping\n\nThe simplest fix is to remove the default argument `chat = chat` from the inner function and just use the `chat` object from the parent function’s environment:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat)) chat <- chat_from_parent  # or directly refer to outer `chat`\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut `chat_from_parent` is a stand-in; we need a way to access the outer `chat`.\n\nBecause of R’s lexical scoping, the inner function can just access the `chat` from the parent environment directly without needing it as a default parameter:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_inner = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat_inner)) chat_inner <- chat  # `chat` here is from the outer scope\n    ch <- chat_inner$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr even simpler, avoid name conflicts like this:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_obj = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat_obj)) chat_obj <- chat\n    ch <- chat_obj$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Solution 2: Use force() to force evaluation of the outer `chat`\n\nIf you want to keep the default argument but want to avoid lazy evaluation issues, you can force the evaluation of the outer `chat` explicitly:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)  # force evaluation here \n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut sometimes the `force()` trick doesn’t work reliably for default arguments referencing other arguments or outer variables.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nBest practice is to avoid default argument values that reference variables of the same name from enclosing scopes or use different names. So solution 1—renaming the inner function’s `chat` argument and using `NULL` as the default—is usually best:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_inner = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat_inner)) chat_inner <- chat\n    ch <- chat_inner$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n- The recursive default argument error is caused by `chat = chat` where the RHS resolves to the argument itself in the inner function, causing a recursion.\n- Avoid naming inner argument the same as an outer variable with a default referring to outer variable.\n- Use a different argument name (`chat_inner`) with default `NULL` and then assign it lexically from the outer `chat`.\n- This fixes the default argument evaluation recursion problem.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to explain any point or help with further modifications, just ask!"

So solution 1—renaming the inner function’s `chat` argument and using `NULL` as the default—is usually best:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_inner = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat_inner)) chat_inner <- chat\n    ch <- chat_inner$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n- The recursive default argument error is caused by `chat = chat` where the RHS resolves to the argument itself in the inner function, causing a recursion.\n- Avoid naming inner argument the same as an outer variable with a default referring to outer variable.\n- Use a different argument name (`chat_inner`) with default `NULL` and then assign it lexically from the outer `chat`.\n- This fixes the default argument evaluation recursion problem.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to explain any point or help with further modifications, just ask!"

The inner function defines a parameter `chat` that defaults to the outer function's `chat` argument. But that leads to confusion in R evaluation because the inner `chat` argument looks to itself when setting the default.\n\n## Why?\n\n- The outer function `generate()` accepts an argument `chat`.\n- The inner function (returned) also accepts an argument `chat`, defaulting to `chat`.\n- But when you write `chat = chat` inside the inner function's formal arguments, R tries to evaluate the default for the inner `chat` **parameter** using the inner `chat` itself (because default arguments are lazy, and the same name refers to the argument).\n- This is why you get the `promise already under evaluation` error.\n\n## How to fix?\n\nYou want the inner function's `chat` default to be the *outer* function's `chat`. But `chat = chat` is ambiguous in the inner function's formal parameters.\n\n### Solution 1: Rename inner parameter\n\nRename the inner function's argument to something else, e.g. `chat_inner` or `chat2`:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_inner = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_inner$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow the inner `chat_inner` defaults to the `chat` captured from the outer function's environment; no naming conflicts.\n\n### Solution 2: Remove default argument for inner `chat` and assign inside function\n\nAlternatively, omit the `chat` argument in the inner function and rely on `chat` from the closure environment:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat)) chat <- chat\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut this won't work as intended because `chat <- chat` inside the inner function again creates ambiguity.\n\nBetter to write:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat2 = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat2)) chat2 <- chat\n    ch <- chat2$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Solution 3: Use `force()` on outer chat and do not shadow argument names\n\nSometimes it helps to force evaluation of outer `chat` to avoid lazy evaluation confusion:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)  # force evaluation now\n  \n  function(input, chat_inner = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_inner$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is similar to solution 1 but explicitly forces outer argument evaluation early.\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\n**Key fix:** Don't use the same argument name for the inner function default value. Rename inner argument to avoid the recursive evaluation:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat_inner = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_inner$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will prevent the recursive default argument reference and let your code work correctly."

The code you wrote above (the `renderPlot({ ... })` block) is outside the server function — it just sits in the global environment and never gets assigned to the `output` list within the server.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix it:\n\nYou need to move the reactive expressions and your output render definition **inside the `server` function**, so Shiny can properly use them.\n\n---\n\n### Here's a corrected version of your app with explanations:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  \n  # Reactive expression that filters the data\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition)           # Ensure input$condition is available\n    req(input$visit_threshold)     # Ensure input$visit_threshold is available\n    \n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data available for the selected filters\"),\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold >= 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    # Create linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    # Plot\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the important fixes:\n\n- **Put all your reactive expressions inside the `server` function.**\n- **Directly use `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` inside reactive expressions — no need to create separate `reactive()` for just returning these inputs.**\n- Add `req()` calls in reactive expressions or `validate()` inside render to prevent errors when inputs are not ready.\n- Your `server` function defines both filtered data reactive and `renderPlot` output.\n- Then pass that `server` function to `shinyApp()`.\n\n---\n\nTry this corrected app, and the error about `Can't read output 'plot'` should be gone.",

The submitted answer explains that all reactive expressions and outputs should be inside the server function.\n\nThe solution provided properly:\n1. Identifies the problem (render code was outside the server function)\n2. Correctly moves all reactive expressions inside the server function\n3. Properly assigns the renderPlot function to output$plot\n4. Fixes the parentheses issue with reactive functions\n5. Adds additional error handling with req()\n\nThe submission's solution is functionally equivalent to the one described in the criterion, though it includes additional improvements and details. The core fix - moving the rendering code into the server function - is correctly implemented.\n\nThe structure provided is correct with a proper server function that contains both the reactive expressions and the output$plot assignment.\n\nGRADE: C",

You just write:\n\n```r\noutput$plot\n```\n\ninstead of assigning it a render function, like you did outside the server function.\n\n---\n\n### What's wrong:\n\n- Your `renderPlot` code is outside the `server` function.\n- Inside the `shinyApp()`, your `server` function is defined as:\n\n```r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n  output$plot\n})\n```\n\nThat basically doesn't assign `output$plot` inside the server context.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix it:\n\nYou must place **all the reactive expressions and output assignments** inside the server function.\n\nHere is a corrected and minimal structure:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Reactives\n  ckd_condition <- reactive({\n    input$condition\n  })\n\n  visit_threshold <- reactive({\n    input$visit_threshold\n  })\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition(), VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold())\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    # Check if data has rows to avoid lm errors\n    req(nrow(data) > 0)\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n1. Wrap the reactive expressions and output definitions **inside** the server function.\n2. When you call reactive expressions like `ckd_condition` and `visit_threshold`, use parentheses `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()` because they are functions.\n3. Add a check (e.g. `req(nrow(data) > 0)`) before modeling to make sure the data is non-empty.\n4. Your original code assigned `filtered_data` but used `ckd_condition` inside the `filter` using `==` with `ckd_condition` (without parentheses) which is wrong — you need `ckd_condition()` to get the reactive value.\n\n---\n\nFix those, and the error about not reading the output will go away. Your app will run properly.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The suggested solution properly changes:\n   `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token`\n   to:\n   `out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`\n\n3. The submission includes a full updated function with this change, but makes no other modifications to the function.\n\nThe solution exactly matches what was required by the criterion. The submission correctly addresses the partial matching issue by using the `[[]]` notation, which requires exact name matching, instead of the `$` notation which allows partial matching. This prevents the unintended match with `refresh_token_expires_in`.\n\nGRADE: C"

Desired outcome is shown in the `result` column:\n\n```\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n          ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n            \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n            \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n          )\npipe\n#> # A tibble: 2 x 3\n#>   referral_key appointment_key result      \n#>   <chr>        <chr>           <chr>       \n#> 1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1\n#> 2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2\n```\n\nHow can I do this with the tidyverse?\n***\n[Submission]: You can achieve this by splitting the `appointment_key` string using the pipes `||` as separators, then inserting \"T\" and \"A\" in between the split parts. Since there are exactly two `||` separators, the string splits into three parts.\n\nHere's one way using `tidyverse` (specifically `dplyr` and `stringr`):\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npipe <- tibble::tribble(\n  ~referral_key, ~appointment_key,        ~result,\n  \"OP3349021\", \"4289||10410||1\", \"4289T10410A1\",\n  \"OP3359764\", \"4289||10410||2\", \"4289T10410A2\"\n)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Split the string by \"||\"\n    parts = str_split(appointment_key, fixed(\"||\")),\n    # parts is a list-column; extract parts and join with letters\n    result_calc = map_chr(parts, ~ paste0(.x[1], \"T\", .x[2], \"A\", .x[3]))\n  )\n```\n\nThis gives:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  referral_key appointment_key result      result_calc\n  <chr>        <chr>           <chr>       <chr>      \n1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1 4289T10410A1\n2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2 4289T10410A2\n```\n\nYour `result_calc` column matches the desired `result`.\n\n### Explanation:\n- `str_split(appointment_key, fixed(\"||\"))` splits the string at the exact substring \"||\".\n- `map_chr` applies a function on each list element (vector of 3 parts), glueing the parts together with \"T\" and \"A\".\n\n---\n\nIf you want a one-liner without intermediate list-columns:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(result = map_chr(str_split(appointment_key, fixed(\"||\")), ~ paste0(.x[1], \"T\", .x[2], \"A\", .x[3])))\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to handle varying numbers of separators or a more general solution!\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It then uses `map_chr()` to combine those parts with \"T\" and \"A\" between them.\n3. The approach correctly produces the desired result, but it does not follow the specific method required by the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifically states that the solution should:\n- Call `str_replace()` twice in order\n- Not use `str_replace_all()`\n- Replace the first instance of `||` with \"T\" and the second instance with \"A\"\n\nThe submission doesn't use `str_replace()` at all, instead using a completely different approach with `str_split()` and `map_chr()`.

This will keep rows of `df2` that have matching `key1` and `key2` in `df1`.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n```\n\nThis will return all columns of `df2` for rows where `(key1, key2)` exists in `df1`.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n- `semi_join(x, y, by=...)` returns all rows of `x` that have a match in `y` based on the columns in `by`, but does not duplicate rows or add columns.\n- Useful for filtering a dataframe to only those rows whose keys are present in another dataframe.\n\n---\n\n### Example with given data:\n\n```r\ndf1 <- data.frame(\n  key1 = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'),\n  key2 = c(1, 2, 3, 4),\n  var3 = rnorm(4),\n  var4 = letters[1:4]\n)\n\ndf2 <- data.frame(\n  key1 = c('a', 'b', 'e', 'f'),\n  key2 = c(1, 2, 4, 5),\n  var3 = runif(4),\n  var4 = LETTERS[1:4]\n)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n\nprint(common_df)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n  key1 key2       var3 var4\n1    a    1 0.28757752    A\n2    b    2 0.78830514    B\n```\n\nThis matches your requirement!",

If you want to apply a function to a **single column**, you can still use `across()`, but the `.names` argument expects a glue specification for the name pattern of the new columns.\n3. Here you provide `.names = \"x\"`, which means the output column will be named literally `\"x\"`. This is probably fine, but you need to make sure no trailing commas are there.\n4. You have a trailing comma in `.names = \"x\",` which is invalid syntax in function arguments.\n5. Also, `across()` returns a data frame, so `mutate()` will add one or more columns with the new names.\n\n---\n\n### What is the fix?\n\n- Remove the trailing comma after `.names = \"x\"`.\n- The first argument to `across()` can be `vs` by name, but if `vs` is a single column, you can simply do `across(c(vs), ...)` (use `c()` or `all_of(\"vs\")`).\n- Or simpler, just use `mutate(x = vs + 1)` if you want to create a new column `x` with `vs + 1`.\n- If you want to use `across()`, use the proper syntax:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, ~ .x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\n**Note:** The lambda shorthand `\\(x)` is available in R versions >=4.1.0; but sometimes it causes issues if there are trailing commas.\n\nAlso, your lambda function is fine—`\\(x) x + 1` is valid; just don't leave trailing commas.\n\n---\n\n### Example of working code:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |> \n  mutate(across(vs, ~ .x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\nThis will add a new column `x` which is `vs + 1`.\n\n---\n\n### Summary: Your offending code had:\n\n- A trailing comma after `.names = \"x\",`\n- Possibly incorrect use of `across()` first argument (you can just use `vs` or `c(vs)`)\n\nFix by:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\n(or using formula syntax `~`):\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, ~ .x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full reproducible example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Works fine:\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, ~ .x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```r\n# A tibble with an added column `x` = vs + 1\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you want to just mutate the existing column `vs` by adding 1, you can also do:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n```\n\n`across()` is more useful with multiple columns.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The weird error about \"unused argument (alist())\" is often due to trailing commas or some parsing errors in the function call, so fix the trailing comma first."

However, because it's not exported, **referencing `closest()` directly will cause lint/build issues, and it's not good practice to rely on non-exported/internal functions** since they can change without notice.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix this?\n\n#### 1. Avoid using `closest()` from dplyr directly\n\nSince it's an internal function, you should avoid calling it directly, especially with `dplyr::closest()`, which is not possible.\n\n#### 2. Check if there's a public API alternative\n\nYou can check if there is a public function that provides the functionality you want (e.g., if `closest()` is used to find the nearest value, you might use other vectorized functions or approaches).\n\n#### 3. If you **really** need to use it, import it explicitly with `dplyr:::closest()` (triple colon)\n\nYou can call internal unexported functions with `dplyr:::closest()`. For example:\n\n```r\ndplyr:::closest(...)\n```\n\n**But this is discouraged** in package development because using triple colon (`:::`) accesses internal functions and could break if the package author changes or removes it.\n\n#### 4. Copy/Edit the function yourself\n\nIf you want the behavior of `closest()`, you can copy the function source code into your package (giving proper credit) and adjust it as needed.\n\n#### 5. Suppress lint warnings selectively (not recommended generally)\n\nIf lint or build notes bother you, you could suppress them but better to fix the root cause.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- `closest()` is not an exported dplyr function.\n- You cannot use `dplyr::closest()`.\n- You **can** use `dplyr:::closest()` but it’s not best practice.\n- Ideally, find an exported alternative or implement your own version.\n\n---\n\n### How to find if `closest()` exists internally\n\nRun:\n\n```r\nls(\"package:dplyr\", all.names = TRUE)  # lists all exported and internal functions\n```\n\nYou will see `\"closest\"` in the list, but it's not exported.
