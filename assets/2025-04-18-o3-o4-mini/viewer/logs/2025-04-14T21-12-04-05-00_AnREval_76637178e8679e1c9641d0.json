Set `Flag = 1` if both conditions are **TRUE**, otherwise `0`.\n\nLet's do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Step 1: Check if each ID has at least one Type_II\nhas_typeII <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Step 2: For each ID, count if there are any pairs of Type_I visits at least 90 days apart\ntypeI_90d <- df %>%\n  filter(type == \"Type_I\") %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n_typeI = n(),\n    # Find if there are any pairs at least 90 days apart\n    any_90d = {\n      dates <- sort(unique(date))\n      if(length(dates) < 2) FALSE else any(outer(dates, dates, FUN = function(x,y) abs(as.numeric(x-y))) >= 90)\n    },\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n# Step 3: Join and compute flag\nflags <- has_typeII %>%\n  inner_join(typeI_90d, by = \"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_typeII & n_typeI >= 2 & any_90d)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\n# View the result\nflags\n\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n|ID     | Flag |\n|-------|------|\n|000000 | 0    |\n|000001 | 1    |\n|000002 | 1    |\n|000003 | 1    |\n|000004 | 1    |\n|000005 | 1    |\n|000006 | 0    |\n\n---\n\n#### **Explanation**\n\n- **has_typeII**: TRUE if an ID has at least one \"Type_II\".\n- **typeI_90d**:\n  - counts the number (`n_typeI`) of Type_I for each ID,\n  - checks if there's at least **one pair** of Type_I visits at least 90 days apart (`any_90d`).\n- **Flag**: 1 if both have Type_II **and** at least 2 Type_I visits at least 90 days apart.\n\n#### **On Pairs:**\nWe use `outer(dates, dates, ...)` to take all pairs, but you could also compute only pairs where `x < y` for efficiency.\n\n---\n\n**If you want a fully piped, compact version:**\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    typeI_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    n_typeI = sum(type == \"Type_I\"),\n    any_90d = {\n      d <- sort(unique(date[type == \"Type_I\"]))\n      if(length(d) < 2) FALSE else any(outer(d, d, FUN = function(x,y) abs(as.numeric(x-y))) >= 90)\n    },\n    Flag = as.integer(has_typeII & n_typeI >= 2 & any_90d),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want the code explained further or made more efficient!",

For each `ID`, select `\"Type_I\"` rows, compute all pairwise date differences, and check if **any pair** is at least 90 days apart.\n3.

The mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable, with NAs properly handled.\n\nLet's analyze the submission:\n\n**What the submission does correctly:**\n- Uses `lag()` to create a previous flight delay column\n- Arranges the data chronologically \n- Handles NA values appropriately\n- Creates a visualization showing the relationship between previous and current delays\n- Provides clear code and explanations\n\n**What the submission misses:**\n- The submission arranges by `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time` but doesn't group by `origin`. This means it's potentially using delays from different airports as predictors, which doesn't match the real-world scenario described in the criterion.\n- The submission bins the previous delays rather than grouping by the exact numeric values (though the criterion does mention this is acceptable).\n\nThe main issue is that the submission fails to account for the airport-specific nature of delays. A delay at one airport shouldn't affect departures at another airport, but the submitted code treats all flights as one continuous sequence regardless of airport.\n\nSince the submission contains a correct approach to handling the data and visualization but misses a key conceptual requirement (grouping by origin), it is partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

You want to **visualize how the departure delay of a flight relates to the departure delay of the previous flight**, using the `flights` data set, the tidyverse, and `dplyr::lag()`.\n\n**Here's a step-by-step approach:**\n\n1. **Arrange the data in departure order** (e.g., by `year`, `month`, `day`, and `dep_time`).\n2. **Add a column for the lagged departure delay**: this is the previous flight's `dep_delay`.\n3. **Bin the x axis for smoother means** — optionally use something like `cut_number()` or `bin` with `group_by()`.\n4. **Compute the mean dep_delay for each (lagged dep_delay) bin**.\n5. **Plot the result**.\n\n**Here’s how you might do this:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) # previous flight's dep_delay\n\n# Remove any rows where prev_dep_delay is NA (i.e., first row)\nflights_lagged_clean <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay))\n\n# Optionally, bin the prev_dep_delay for a smoother plot\nflights_binned <- flights_lagged_clean %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-50, 400, 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            prev_dep_delay = mean(prev_dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>%\n  filter(n > 50) # only plot bins with lots of flights\n\n# Plot\nggplot(flights_binned, aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay of Next Flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Temporal correlation of departure delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\n**What does this plot do?**\n\n- **Each point**: represents a bin of flights with similar previous departure delay.\n- **x-axis**: average previous (immediately prior) flight’s delay (in minutes)\n- **y-axis**: mean delay of the flight following those\n- **Line**: shows trend—does a delayed flight tend to be followed by more delays?\n\n---\n\n**Alternative: Scatterplot with smoothing**\n\nIf you want a raw scatter + smoother, try:\n\n```r\nflights_lagged_clean %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.05) +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Current Flight's Departure Delay (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Temporal correlation of departure delays (scatterplot)\"\n  ) +\n  xlim(-50, 400) +\n  ylim(-50, 400)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Use `lag()` to get previous flight’s delay.\n- Arrange your data.\n- Compute means or use smoothers for visualization.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to group by, say, origin as well!\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission based on the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key requirements:\n1. The lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin` since delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at other airports\n2. Mean departure delay should be calculated by the numeric lagged departure delay value\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nThe code does not group by `origin` when creating the lagged values. Instead, it simply arranges by time and calculates lags across all airports:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>% # ensure chronological order\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n```\n\nThe correct approach would be something like:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n```\nor with the older syntax:\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n```\n\nIn the alternative solution, the submission does bin the previous delay values and calculate mean delays by those bins, which is similar to the criterion's requirement, but still doesn't account for the origin airport grouping.\n\nThe submission handles NAs appropriately with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))` and includes `na.rm = TRUE` in the mean calculation in the alternative solution.\n\nWhile the visualizations are appropriate and the explanation is thorough, the fundamental issue is that the submission fails to account for the airport-specific nature of delays, which is the main point of the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

                      "text": "Great analysis idea! You want to study the relationship between a flight’s departure delay and that of the **immediately previous** flight, to see if delays propagate.\n\nHere’s how you’d do this with the tidyverse (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`). The key steps:\n1. **Sort** the data so consecutive rows are in the true departure order.\n2. **Compute lagged dep_delay** with `lag()`.\n3. **Group and summarize** to show mean `dep_delay` for bins of the previous flight’s delay, **or** use a smoother for a continuous trend.\n\nHere’s a concrete implementation:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nycflights13) # for the flights data\n\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>% # ensure chronological order\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    geom_bin2d(bins = 100) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight (minutes)\",\n      y = \"Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n      title = \"Propagation of Departure Delays\"\n    ) +\n    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-20, 100), ylim = c(-20, 100))\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `arrange()` ensures flights are in temporal order.\n- `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` grabs the previous row’s delay.\n- `filter()` removes NAs (e.g. the first flight, or missing data).\n- `geom_bin2d()` shows density (because there are LOTS of points).\n- `geom_smooth()` overlays the mean trend.\n- `coord_cartesian()` zooms in on more interpretable ranges.\n\n**Alternative:** For more direct visualization, group by binned previous delay (e.g. in 10 min bins) and plot means:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-60, 180, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay, group = 1)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (binned, minutes)\",\n      y = \"Mean Departure Delay\",\n      title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs. Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n    ) +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n**Both solutions show:**  \nHow the delay of one flight predicts the delay of the next — you’ll likely see a positive association!"

                  "text": "Great analysis idea! You want to study the relationship between a flight’s departure delay and that of the **immediately previous** flight, to see if delays propagate.\n\nHere’s how you’d do this with the tidyverse (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`). The key steps:\n1. **Sort** the data so consecutive rows are in the true departure order.\n2. **Compute lagged dep_delay** with `lag()`.\n3. **Group and summarize** to show mean `dep_delay` for bins of the previous flight’s delay, **or** use a smoother for a continuous trend.\n\nHere’s a concrete implementation:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nycflights13) # for the flights data\n\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>% # ensure chronological order\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n    geom_bin2d(bins = 100) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"gam\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight (minutes)\",\n      y = \"Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n      title = \"Propagation of Departure Delays\"\n    ) +\n    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-20, 100), ylim = c(-20, 100))\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `arrange()` ensures flights are in temporal order.\n- `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` grabs the previous row’s delay.\n- `filter()` removes NAs (e.g. the first flight, or missing data).\n- `geom_bin2d()` shows density (because there are LOTS of points).\n- `geom_smooth()` overlays the mean trend.\n- `coord_cartesian()` zooms in on more interpretable ranges.\n\n**Alternative:** For more direct visualization, group by binned previous delay (e.g. in 10 min bins) and plot means:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-60, 180, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay, group = 1)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (binned, minutes)\",\n      y = \"Mean Departure Delay\",\n      title = \"Mean Departure Delay vs. Previous Flight's Departure Delay\"\n    ) +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n**Both solutions show:**  \nHow the delay of one flight predicts the delay of the next — you’ll likely see a positive association!",

          "explanation": "I'll evaluate the submission based on the given criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly addresses the key requirements:\n\n1. It recognizes that delays are temporally correlated within the same airport (origin), which is the most important insight for this question.\n2. It arranges flights by origin and time variables (year, month, day, dep_time) to ensure the lag function works properly.\n3. It properly groups by origin when applying the lag function to get the previous flight's delay.\n4. It correctly filters out NA values before calculating means.\n5. It computes the mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay, which meets the criterion.\n6. It provides visualization code that plots the mean departure delay against the lagged departure delay.\n\nThe solution even includes an enhancement by rounding the lagged departure delay values, which the criterion explicitly states is acceptable. The code also filters for bins with enough data (n > 10), which is a good statistical practice though not required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission provides two alternative approaches (with and without binning/summarizing), both of which would work correctly. The general approach matches the example solution provided in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Certainly! The task is to **visualize the relationship between a flight’s departure delay and that of the immediately preceding flight**. To do this, you can use `dplyr::lag()` to retrieve the prior flight’s `dep_delay`, then plot with `ggplot2`.\n\n### 1. What do we **lag** by?\n\nDelays are temporally correlated **within a single day and origin** (i.e., at the same airport). So we should sort flights by `origin`, then for each origin, **by time** (probably `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time`), then `lag()` within those groups.\n\n### 2. Code\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights_lag <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Now plot\nflights_lag %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag)) %>%\n  group_by(dep_delay_lag = round(dep_delay_lag)) %>%  # bin by prior delay (optional, can leave out)\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) %>%\n  filter(n > 10) %>%  # only plot bins with enough data\n  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay_lag, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay of current flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Mean departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- We arrange by `origin`, `year`, `month`, `day`, `dep_time` to ensure flights are in correct order for each origin.\n- We group and `mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay))` **per origin**.\n- We optionally bin `dep_delay_lag` for a cleaner plot, but you can plot all points if desired.\n- `geom_smooth()` reveals the trend.\n\n---\n\n**If you want to see the \"raw\" scatterplot** without summarizing:\n\n```r\nflights_lag %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay_lag, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure delay of current flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Current flight's dep_delay vs. previous flight's dep_delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `lag()` grouped by `origin`, sorted by time.\n- Make scatter or summary plot of current delay vs. previous delay.\n\nLet me know if you want to focus on a single origin or see the code for a particular carrier!\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It recognizes that delays are temporally correlated within the same airport (origin), which is the most important insight for this question.\n2. It arranges flights by origin and time variables (year, month, day, dep_time) to ensure the lag function works properly.\n3. It properly groups by origin when applying the lag function to get the previous flight's delay.\n4. It correctly filters out NA values before calculating means.\n5. It computes the mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay, which meets the criterion.\n6. It provides visualization code that plots the mean departure delay against the lagged departure delay.\n\nThe solution even includes an enhancement by rounding the lagged departure delay values, which the criterion explicitly states is acceptable. The code also filters for bins with enough data (n > 10), which is a good statistical practice though not required by the criterion.\n\nThe submission provides two alternative approaches (with and without binning/summarizing), both of which would work correctly. The general approach matches the example solution provided in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C"

You are making a **GET** request that **includes a request body** (`-d` in cURL, `req_body_json` in R).\n- **HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed** means:  \n  > The endpoint (the server) does not expect the HTTP method you're using–in this case, a GET with a body.\n- Most servers **do not accept bodies in GET requests!**  \n  By HTTP/REST conventions, bodies with GET are either ignored or rejected.\n\n---\n\n### How to Fix\n\n#### **Option 1: Change to POST (if server expects POST)**\n\n- In cURL:  \n  Change `-X 'GET'` to `-X 'POST'`\n- In R/httr2:  \n  Add `.req_method(\"POST\")` (because `req_body_json()` implies POST, but be explicit if needed)\n\n#### **Option 2: Move all parameters to the URL query string (if server requires GET)**\n\n- Do **not** use the body.  \n  **Instead**, provide the parameters as query arguments.\n\n**For R with `httr2`:**\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **In summary:**\n- 405 = wrong HTTP method.\n- **GET requests should not have a body!**  \n- If the API expects GET, use `req_url_query()`  \n- If the API expects POST, use `req_body_json()` and set `.req_method(\"POST\")` if needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **How to tell if it should be GET or POST?**\n- **API docs!**  \n- If you are sending a body, it's almost always POST (sometimes PUT/PATCH).\n\n---\n\n### **If you show me the API docs or endpoint description, I can help you with the *correct* syntax!**\n\n---\n\n#### **Example for POST:**\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  ) %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\")\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **Example for GET (move params to query string):**\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\",\n    fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need more help or share the API docs/endpoint, and I'll give you the exact code!**",

If you're supposed to use **GET**\n\nMove your parameters to the query string:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n     -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n     -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n- You do **not** need `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'` for GET.\n- You do **not** need `-d` for GET.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. If you're supposed to use **POST**\n\nIf the API you’re using expects a request body, then change **GET** to **POST**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n---\n\n### B. How to fix your R (httr2) code\n\n#### 1. For GET:\nNo body. Pass parameters in the URL:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, \n    fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\" \n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n#### 2. For POST:\nBody is fine! Just change the HTTP verb if needed:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    \"Content-Type\"= \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n|            | GET (No Body)                                      | POST (With Body)                    |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| curl       | Use query params, no -d/body                        | Use -d/body, set method to POST     |\n| httr2 (R)  | Use req_url_query(), no req_body_json()             | Use req_body_json(), set POST       |\n\n---\n\n### **TL;DR**\n- **GET**: No body, use URL query parameters.\n- **POST**: Use body (json), change method.\n\n---\n\n**If unsure which method to use, check the API documentation.** Servers often return 405 if you use the wrong method.\n\nLet me know if you need more help!",

How to fix your `curl`\n\n#### 1. If you're supposed to use **GET**\n\nMove your parameters to the query string:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n     -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n     -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n- You do **not** need `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'` for GET.\n- You do **not** need `-d` for GET.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. If you're supposed to use **POST**\n\nIf the API you’re using expects a request body, then change **GET** to **POST**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n---\n\n### B. How to fix your R (httr2) code\n\n#### 1. For GET:\nNo body.

                  "text": "Great! You've already identified a typical issue in HTTP requests:\n\n## The Problem\n\nYour `curl` command is:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\n  ... \\\n  -d '{ ... }'\n```\n\nYou're making a **GET** request, but you are **sending a data payload/body**.  \n**According to the HTTP/REST specification, GET requests should not have a body.**\n\nMost servers will reject GET requests with a body and reply with `405 Method Not Allowed` or sometimes with `400 Bad Request`.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\nYou should:\n- Only use a request body (**-d**) for methods like POST, PUT, PATCH.\n- For GET requests, send parameters as **query parameters in the URL**, for example:  \n  `https://your.url/endpoint?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01`\n\n**Only use -d with POST/PUT/PATCH**\n\n---\n\n### A. How to fix your `curl`\n\n#### 1. If you're supposed to use **GET**\n\nMove your parameters to the query string:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n     -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n     -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n- You do **not** need `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'` for GET.\n- You do **not** need `-d` for GET.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. If you're supposed to use **POST**\n\nIf the API you’re using expects a request body, then change **GET** to **POST**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n---\n\n### B. How to fix your R (httr2) code\n\n#### 1. For GET:\nNo body. Pass parameters in the URL:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, \n    fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", \n    fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\" \n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n#### 2. For POST:\nBody is fine! Just change the HTTP verb if needed:\n\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    \"Content-Type\"= \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial=\"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal=\"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n|            | GET (No Body)                                      | POST (With Body)                    |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| curl       | Use query params, no -d/body                        | Use -d/body, set method to POST     |\n| httr2 (R)  | Use req_url_query(), no req_body_json()             | Use req_body_json(), set POST       |\n\n---\n\n### **TL;DR**\n- **GET**: No body, use URL query parameters.\n- **POST**: Use body (json), change method.\n\n---\n\n**If unsure which method to use, check the API documentation.** Servers often return 405 if you use the wrong method.\n\nLet me know if you need more help!",

If you want to hide the extra entry completely, you can filter it out of the plot but not the legend with various tricks, but for your use case (show all levels in legend with correct dot), the dummy row is the canonical solution.\n\n---\n\n### Full reproducible example\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n**You will now see a green dot next to \"d\" in the legend!**\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: This is a great question and touches on a quirk of how **ggplot2** displays legends for **unused factor levels** when `drop = FALSE` in a discrete scale. ggplot2, by default, will **not show a key glyph** (legend symbol) for groups that do not appear in the data, unless you add some data for that group. The \"blanks\" for \"d\" are because there are no data points with that level, so the legend is empty for it.\n\n## Solution 1: Add a `d` row with `NA` for positions\n\nYou can supply an \"empty\" data row (e.g. with `NA`s for positions), but with `z == \"d\"`, so that the color/shape glyph gets used:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add an NA/dummy row for the missing level\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, z=factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nThis will **show a green dot for \"d\" in the legend**.  \nThe use of `na.rm=TRUE` ensures the NA point does not appear on the plot itself.\n\n## Solution 2: Show all levels in the legend with `show.legend = TRUE` in a separate geom\n\nAnother approach is to use a separate (e.g. zero-size, off-plot) geom just to create the legend entry:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  # This adds an invisible geom for the missing level,\n  # which triggers legend key\n  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])),\n             aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n(It's essentially the same trick: adding a row to trigger the legend entry.)\n\n## Solution 3: Custom legend guide\n\nIf you need more control, you can use `override.aes` in the legend guide:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\nBut **this won't create a symbol for \"d\" if no such data exist**; you still need to add a dummy data row.\n\n## **Summary**\n\n**To show a colored dot for unused levels in the legend, add a dummy row for the missing factor(s) with NAs for position.**  \nThis is the most reliable and idiomatic way in ggplot2.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

                  "text": "This is a great question and touches on a quirk of how **ggplot2** displays legends for **unused factor levels** when `drop = FALSE` in a discrete scale. ggplot2, by default, will **not show a key glyph** (legend symbol) for groups that do not appear in the data, unless you add some data for that group. The \"blanks\" for \"d\" are because there are no data points with that level, so the legend is empty for it.\n\n## Solution 1: Add a `d` row with `NA` for positions\n\nYou can supply an \"empty\" data row (e.g. with `NA`s for positions), but with `z == \"d\"`, so that the color/shape glyph gets used:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add an NA/dummy row for the missing level\ndf2 <- rbind(df, data.frame(x=NA, y=NA, z=factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])))\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\nThis will **show a green dot for \"d\" in the legend**.  \nThe use of `na.rm=TRUE` ensures the NA point does not appear on the plot itself.\n\n## Solution 2: Show all levels in the legend with `show.legend = TRUE` in a separate geom\n\nAnother approach is to use a separate (e.g. zero-size, off-plot) geom just to create the legend entry:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  # This adds an invisible geom for the missing level,\n  # which triggers legend key\n  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels=letters[1:4])),\n             aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n\n(It's essentially the same trick: adding a row to trigger the legend entry.)\n\n## Solution 3: Custom legend guide\n\nIf you need more control, you can use `override.aes` in the legend guide:\n\n```r\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))\n```\nBut **this won't create a symbol for \"d\" if no such data exist**; you still need to add a dummy data row.\n\n## **Summary**\n\n**To show a colored dot for unused levels in the legend, add a dummy row for the missing factor(s) with NAs for position.**  \nThis is the most reliable and idiomatic way in ggplot2.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submission correctly addresses the criterion: formatting the address to result in a valid URL by replacing spaces and punctuation, or using URL encoding functions.\n\nThe submission provides two solutions that effectively address the URL encoding issue:\n\n1. It recommends using `curl::curl_escape()` to properly encode the address parameter, which handles spaces and punctuation characters correctly.\n2. It suggests a better approach using `httr2::req_url_query()` which automatically handles the URL encoding of parameters.\n\nBoth approaches are valid solutions to the problem. The submission correctly identifies that spaces and commas in the URL need to be properly encoded, and provides proper code examples that handle the URL encoding issue.\n\nThe criterion mentioned that either replacing spaces with `+` characters or using functions like `URLencode()` or `url_encode()` would be acceptable. The submission uses `curl::curl_escape()` which is equivalent to these functions for URL encoding purposes. The submission even goes beyond by showing a more modern and recommended approach using `req_url_query()`.\n\nThe submission thoroughly addresses the issue of URL encoding the address parameter, which is the core requirement of the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

This means, for instance, that providing `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)` on the main scale doesn't automatically use \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" for the secondary axis unless you explicitly set the `labels` argument.  \nWhat you want: For discrete axes, when `breaks` has names, those names should be used as default labels on the secondary axis, **unless** a user explicitly supplies something else as `labels`.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nYou need to adjust the part of the AxisSecondary$init method that handles `self$labels`, specifically the line:  \n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nand perhaps add logic so that, if the (discrete) `self$breaks` vector has names and `labels` is not set (i.e., is.derived()), set `self$labels` to `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n### Proposed patch (only relevant portions):\n\nReplace this part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n**with equivalent of:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If breaks has names, use those names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    # Get the actual vector (might be function)\n    # If user supplied a function for breaks, we *could* call it with scale limits, like scale$get_breaks()\n    brks_eval <- brks\n    if (is.function(brks_eval)) {\n      # Evaluate function to get breaks using scale$get_limits() (fallback to scale$get_breaks() if available)\n      lims <- tryCatch(scale$get_limits(), error = function(e) NULL)\n      if (!is.null(lims)) {\n        brks_eval <- brks_eval(lims)\n      } else if (\"get_breaks\" %in% methods(class(scale))) {\n        brks_eval <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        brks_eval <- NULL\n      }\n    }\n    if (!is.null(brks_eval) && !is.null(names(brks_eval)) && any(nzchar(names(brks_eval)))) {\n      self$labels <- names(brks_eval)\n    } else {\n      self$labels <- scale$labels\n    }\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(You may simplify the function break-code above if you always expect `breaks` to be an evaluated vector at this point.)\n\n---\n\n### Or, if you want a more minimal/most robust version, and if your code always stores the actual vector (not just a function for breaks) in `self$breaks` at this point, then in AxisSecondary$init, do this:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full context integration\n\nReplace this block in your `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**with this:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the change\n\n**Change this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**To this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose you set  \n```r\nscale_x_discrete(breaks = c(a=1, b=2, c=3))\n```\nThen the secondary axis should by default use labels \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", unless explicitly overridden.\n\n---\n\n**You can copy-paste this diff for the edit.**"

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for editing code to ensure that, when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default in secondary axes in ggplot2.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific code changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving the names during the breaks assignment and mapping, it focuses on modifying the `AxisSecondary$init` method to check if the breaks have names and, if so, use those names as labels:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhile this approach might achieve a similar outcome, it doesn't match the specific code changes required by the criterion. The criterion focuses on ensuring the named breaks are properly preserved at two specific points in the code, whereas the submission modifies the way labels are assigned based on those names.\n\nThe submission doesn't make either of the two specific changes requested in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

This means, for instance, that providing `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)` on the main scale doesn't automatically use \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" for the secondary axis unless you explicitly set the `labels` argument.  \nWhat you want: For discrete axes, when `breaks` has names, those names should be used as default labels on the secondary axis, **unless** a user explicitly supplies something else as `labels`.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nYou need to adjust the part of the AxisSecondary$init method that handles `self$labels`, specifically the line:  \n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nand perhaps add logic so that, if the (discrete) `self$breaks` vector has names and `labels` is not set (i.e., is.derived()), set `self$labels` to `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n### Proposed patch (only relevant portions):\n\nReplace this part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n**with equivalent of:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If breaks has names, use those names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    # Get the actual vector (might be function)\n    # If user supplied a function for breaks, we *could* call it with scale limits, like scale$get_breaks()\n    brks_eval <- brks\n    if (is.function(brks_eval)) {\n      # Evaluate function to get breaks using scale$get_limits() (fallback to scale$get_breaks() if available)\n      lims <- tryCatch(scale$get_limits(), error = function(e) NULL)\n      if (!is.null(lims)) {\n        brks_eval <- brks_eval(lims)\n      } else if (\"get_breaks\" %in% methods(class(scale))) {\n        brks_eval <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        brks_eval <- NULL\n      }\n    }\n    if (!is.null(brks_eval) && !is.null(names(brks_eval)) && any(nzchar(names(brks_eval)))) {\n      self$labels <- names(brks_eval)\n    } else {\n      self$labels <- scale$labels\n    }\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(You may simplify the function break-code above if you always expect `breaks` to be an evaluated vector at this point.)\n\n---\n\n### Or, if you want a more minimal/most robust version, and if your code always stores the actual vector (not just a function for breaks) in `self$breaks` at this point, then in AxisSecondary$init, do this:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full context integration\n\nReplace this block in your `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**with this:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the change\n\n**Change this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**To this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose you set  \n```r\nscale_x_discrete(breaks = c(a=1, b=2, c=3))\n```\nThen the secondary axis should by default use labels \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", unless explicitly overridden.\n\n---\n\n**You can copy-paste this diff for the edit.**\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This means, for instance, that providing `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)` on the main scale doesn't automatically use \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" for the secondary axis unless you explicitly set the `labels` argument.  \nWhat you want: For discrete axes, when `breaks` has names, those names should be used as default labels on the secondary axis, **unless** a user explicitly supplies something else as `labels`.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nYou need to adjust the part of the AxisSecondary$init method that handles `self$labels`, specifically the line:  \n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nand perhaps add logic so that, if the (discrete) `self$breaks` vector has names and `labels` is not set (i.e., is.derived()), set `self$labels` to `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n### Proposed patch (only relevant portions):\n\nReplace this part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n**with equivalent of:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If breaks has names, use those names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    # Get the actual vector (might be function)\n    # If user supplied a function for breaks, we *could* call it with scale limits, like scale$get_breaks()\n    brks_eval <- brks\n    if (is.function(brks_eval)) {\n      # Evaluate function to get breaks using scale$get_limits() (fallback to scale$get_breaks() if available)\n      lims <- tryCatch(scale$get_limits(), error = function(e) NULL)\n      if (!is.null(lims)) {\n        brks_eval <- brks_eval(lims)\n      } else if (\"get_breaks\" %in% methods(class(scale))) {\n        brks_eval <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        brks_eval <- NULL\n      }\n    }\n    if (!is.null(brks_eval) && !is.null(names(brks_eval)) && any(nzchar(names(brks_eval)))) {\n      self$labels <- names(brks_eval)\n    } else {\n      self$labels <- scale$labels\n    }\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(You may simplify the function break-code above if you always expect `breaks` to be an evaluated vector at this point.)\n\n---\n\n### Or, if you want a more minimal/most robust version, and if your code always stores the actual vector (not just a function for breaks) in `self$breaks` at this point, then in AxisSecondary$init, do this:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full context integration\n\nReplace this block in your `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**with this:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the change\n\n**Change this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**To this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose you set  \n```r\nscale_x_discrete(breaks = c(a=1, b=2, c=3))\n```\nThen the secondary axis should by default use labels \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", unless explicitly overridden.\n\n---\n\n**You can copy-paste this diff for the edit.**"

This means, for instance, that providing `breaks = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)` on the main scale doesn't automatically use \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" for the secondary axis unless you explicitly set the `labels` argument.  \nWhat you want: For discrete axes, when `breaks` has names, those names should be used as default labels on the secondary axis, **unless** a user explicitly supplies something else as `labels`.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nYou need to adjust the part of the AxisSecondary$init method that handles `self$labels`, specifically the line:  \n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\nand perhaps add logic so that, if the (discrete) `self$breaks` vector has names and `labels` is not set (i.e., is.derived()), set `self$labels` to `names(self$breaks)`.\n\n### Proposed patch (only relevant portions):\n\nReplace this part in `AxisSecondary$init`:\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n**with equivalent of:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  # If breaks has names, use those names as labels\n  if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    # Get the actual vector (might be function)\n    # If user supplied a function for breaks, we *could* call it with scale limits, like scale$get_breaks()\n    brks_eval <- brks\n    if (is.function(brks_eval)) {\n      # Evaluate function to get breaks using scale$get_limits() (fallback to scale$get_breaks() if available)\n      lims <- tryCatch(scale$get_limits(), error = function(e) NULL)\n      if (!is.null(lims)) {\n        brks_eval <- brks_eval(lims)\n      } else if (\"get_breaks\" %in% methods(class(scale))) {\n        brks_eval <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        brks_eval <- NULL\n      }\n    }\n    if (!is.null(brks_eval) && !is.null(names(brks_eval)) && any(nzchar(names(brks_eval)))) {\n      self$labels <- names(brks_eval)\n    } else {\n      self$labels <- scale$labels\n    }\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(You may simplify the function break-code above if you always expect `breaks` to be an evaluated vector at this point.)\n\n---\n\n### Or, if you want a more minimal/most robust version, and if your code always stores the actual vector (not just a function for breaks) in `self$breaks` at this point, then in AxisSecondary$init, do this:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full context integration\n\nReplace this block in your `AxisSecondary$init`:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**with this:**\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary of the change\n\n**Change this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\n**To this:**\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose you set  \n```r\nscale_x_discrete(breaks = c(a=1, b=2, c=3))\n```\nThen the secondary axis should by default use labels \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", unless explicitly overridden.\n\n---\n\n**You can copy-paste this diff for the edit.**",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted solution implements the criterion's specific changes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key changes:\n1. In the init method where discrete breaks are assigned: `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` instead of just `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()`\n2. In the break_info method, changing `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nLooking at the submission, I see they've taken a different approach:\n- They've added a conditional block in the init method to check for named discrete breaks and set labels accordingly\n- Their approach focuses on modifying label handling rather than preserving break names through the mapping process\n- They don't make any changes to the break_info method at all\n\nWhile the submission does address the general concern of handling named breaks for discrete secondary axes, it doesn't implement the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion explicitly requires preserving names during the breaks assignment and mapping process, not adding specialized label handling.\n\nThe submission approaches the problem from a different angle and doesn't implement either of the required changes, so it doesn't meet the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

This is handled in internal discrete scale code, but not in secondary axes.\n\n**Goal:**  \nIf discrete breaks are a named vector and the user has not specified explicit labels (i.e., `labels=derive()`), then the labels should default to `names(breaks)`, falling back to the value if name is `\"\"`.\n\n---\n\n# Minimal Change\n\nWe only need to insert additional logic in AxisSecondary's `init()` method, after setting `self$breaks` and only for discrete scales, **if labels are still derived** at this point.\n\n**Modified part of `AxisSecondary$init`:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  # --- Begin: Add this block to handle default labels for discrete named breaks ---\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    if (is.atomic(brks) && !is.null(names(brks)) && any(nzchar(names(brks)))) {\n      nms <- names(brks)\n      self$labels <- setNames(nms, NULL) # unnamed character vector of names\n      # preserve names, if desired; usually better to keep as vector\n    }\n  }\n  # --- End Add block ---\n\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\n**Key Line:**\n```r\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    if (is.atomic(brks) && !is.null(names(brks)) && any(nzchar(names(brks)))) {\n      nms <- names(brks)\n      self$labels <- setNames(nms, NULL) # unnamed character vector of names\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n- This only fires for discrete axes (when `scale$is_discrete()` is `TRUE`), and *only* if labels are still not overridden by the user (i.e., still a `derived`).\n- If any of the break values have non-empty names, those are used as the default labels.\n- It mimics the internal discrete axis default in ggplot2.\n\n---\n\n# Complete Modified `init` method\n\n**Just replace the entire `init` method in `AxisSecondary` definition with the following:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  # --- Begin: new logic for named discrete breaks as default labels ---\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    if (is.atomic(brks) && !is.null(names(brks)) && any(nzchar(names(brks)))) {\n      nms <- names(brks)\n      self$labels <- setNames(nms, NULL)\n    }\n  }\n  # --- End new logic ---\n\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Change is safe**: Only applies to discrete scales with named atomic breaks.\n- Preserves current inheritance logic; user-set `labels` are still fully respected.\n- **Matches ggplot2's main scale behavior** for default labeling using names of discrete breaks.\n\n---\n\n**Just update the `init` method as shown, and your secondary axis for discrete scales will pick up names of breaks as default labels.**"

This is handled in internal discrete scale code, but not in secondary axes.\n\n**Goal:**  \nIf discrete breaks are a named vector and the user has not specified explicit labels (i.e., `labels=derive()`), then the labels should default to `names(breaks)`, falling back to the value if name is `\"\"`.\n\n---\n\n# Minimal Change\n\nWe only need to insert additional logic in AxisSecondary's `init()` method, after setting `self$breaks` and only for discrete scales, **if labels are still derived** at this point.\n\n**Modified part of `AxisSecondary$init`:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  # --- Begin: Add this block to handle default labels for discrete named breaks ---\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    if (is.atomic(brks) && !is.null(names(brks)) && any(nzchar(names(brks)))) {\n      nms <- names(brks)\n      self$labels <- setNames(nms, NULL) # unnamed character vector of names\n      # preserve names, if desired; usually better to keep as vector\n    }\n  }\n  # --- End Add block ---\n\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\n**Key Line:**\n```r\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    if (is.atomic(brks) && !is.null(names(brks)) && any(nzchar(names(brks)))) {\n      nms <- names(brks)\n      self$labels <- setNames(nms, NULL) # unnamed character vector of names\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n- This only fires for discrete axes (when `scale$is_discrete()` is `TRUE`), and *only* if labels are still not overridden by the user (i.e., still a `derived`).\n- If any of the break values have non-empty names, those are used as the default labels.\n- It mimics the internal discrete axis default in ggplot2.\n\n---\n\n# Complete Modified `init` method\n\n**Just replace the entire `init` method in `AxisSecondary` definition with the following:**\n\n```r\ninit = function(self, scale) {\n  if (self$empty()) {\n    return()\n  }\n  transform <- self$trans\n  if (!is.function(transform)) {\n    cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n  }\n  if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n  if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n  if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n    } else {\n      breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n      n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n      if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n        self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$breaks <- breaks\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  # --- Begin: new logic for named discrete breaks as default labels ---\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n    brks <- self$breaks\n    if (is.atomic(brks) && !is.null(names(brks)) && any(nzchar(names(brks)))) {\n      nms <- names(brks)\n      self$labels <- setNames(nms, NULL)\n    }\n  }\n  # --- End new logic ---\n\n  if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n  if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Change is safe**: Only applies to discrete scales with named atomic breaks.\n- Preserves current inheritance logic; user-set `labels` are still fully respected.\n- **Matches ggplot2's main scale behavior** for default labeling using names of discrete breaks.\n\n---\n\n**Just update the `init` method as shown, and your secondary axis for discrete scales will pick up names of breaks as default labels.**",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for modifying the code to use named discrete breaks as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion states two specific changes that need to be made:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names when getting breaks from the scale.\n\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names when mapping breaks.\n\nLooking at the submission, it doesn't make either of these specific changes. Instead, it adds a more complex logic to handle named breaks for labels:\n\n```r\nif (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n  if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n    self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n  } else {\n    self$labels <- scale$labels\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhile this approach tries to accomplish a similar goal (using names for labels), it's not implementing the specific code changes requested in the criterion. The criterion specifically asks to preserve names through the `setNames()` function at two key points in the code, which would be a more direct solution to the problem.\n\nGRADE: I",

Currently, `sec_axis()` and `dup_axis()` do **not** automatically put breaks' _names_ as default labels for discrete axes, even though this is how ggplot2 handles named breaks on the main axis. \n\nYou can make this more \"ggplot-like\" and convenient by making the secondary axis (for discrete scales) use the breaks' names as default labels if they are present and no explicit labels were provided.\n\n**Where to change**  \nWe need to modify the `AxisSecondary$init()` method.  \nThe relevant block is this:\n\n```r\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\nBut for discrete scales, if `self$breaks` is a named vector, and no labels are explicitly given, we want to use those names.\n\nHere’s the replacement logic:\n\n```r\n    # If labels are derived, set to scale's labels unless discrete scale with named breaks\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n**Result:**\nReplace your current `AxisSecondary$init` method with the following block:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    # Patch: If discrete scale + derived labels + named breaks, use names as labels\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**Summary of edit:**  \n- In `AxisSecondary$init()`, for discrete axes, if `self$labels` is `derive()` and `self$breaks` is a named vector, use the names as labels.\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nThis will now work as expected:\n\n```r\np + scale_x_discrete(\n  sec.axis = sec_axis(\n    breaks = c(a = \"One\", b = \"Two\", c = \"Three\")\n    # labels will become c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") unless otherwise set\n  )\n)\n```\n\nWith this patch, the names of `breaks` will be the labels (unless `labels` is explicitly set).  \nThis matches ggplot2's main-axis behaviour.\n\nLet me know if you want even more robust handling or a PR-style patch!\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Currently, `sec_axis()` and `dup_axis()` do **not** automatically put breaks' _names_ as default labels for discrete axes, even though this is how ggplot2 handles named breaks on the main axis. \n\nYou can make this more \"ggplot-like\" and convenient by making the secondary axis (for discrete scales) use the breaks' names as default labels if they are present and no explicit labels were provided.\n\n**Where to change**  \nWe need to modify the `AxisSecondary$init()` method.  \nThe relevant block is this:\n\n```r\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\nBut for discrete scales, if `self$breaks` is a named vector, and no labels are explicitly given, we want to use those names.\n\nHere’s the replacement logic:\n\n```r\n    # If labels are derived, set to scale's labels unless discrete scale with named breaks\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n**Result:**\nReplace your current `AxisSecondary$init` method with the following block:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    # Patch: If discrete scale + derived labels + named breaks, use names as labels\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**Summary of edit:**  \n- In `AxisSecondary$init()`, for discrete axes, if `self$labels` is `derive()` and `self$breaks` is a named vector, use the names as labels.\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nThis will now work as expected:\n\n```r\np + scale_x_discrete(\n  sec.axis = sec_axis(\n    breaks = c(a = \"One\", b = \"Two\", c = \"Three\")\n    # labels will become c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") unless otherwise set\n  )\n)\n```\n\nWith this patch, the names of `breaks` will be the labels (unless `labels` is explicitly set).  \nThis matches ggplot2's main-axis behaviour.\n\nLet me know if you want even more robust handling or a PR-style patch!"

Currently, `sec_axis()` and `dup_axis()` do **not** automatically put breaks' _names_ as default labels for discrete axes, even though this is how ggplot2 handles named breaks on the main axis. \n\nYou can make this more \"ggplot-like\" and convenient by making the secondary axis (for discrete scales) use the breaks' names as default labels if they are present and no explicit labels were provided.\n\n**Where to change**  \nWe need to modify the `AxisSecondary$init()` method.  \nThe relevant block is this:\n\n```r\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n```\n\nBut for discrete scales, if `self$breaks` is a named vector, and no labels are explicitly given, we want to use those names.\n\nHere’s the replacement logic:\n\n```r\n    # If labels are derived, set to scale's labels unless discrete scale with named breaks\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n**Result:**\nReplace your current `AxisSecondary$init` method with the following block:\n\n```r\n  init = function(self, scale) {\n    if (self$empty()) {\n      return()\n    }\n    transform <- self$trans\n    if (!is.function(transform)) {\n      cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n    if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } else {\n        breaks <- scale$get_transformation()$breaks\n        n_breaks <- scale$n.breaks\n        if (!is.null(n_breaks) && \"n\" %in% fn_fmls_names(breaks)) {\n          self$breaks <- function(x) breaks(x, n = n_breaks)\n        } else {\n          self$breaks <- breaks\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    # Patch: If discrete scale + derived labels + named breaks, use names as labels\n    if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n      if (scale$is_discrete() && !is.null(names(self$breaks)) && any(nzchar(names(self$breaks)))) {\n        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n      } else {\n        self$labels <- scale$labels\n      }\n    }\n    if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n  },\n```\n\n**Summary of edit:**  \n- In `AxisSecondary$init()`, for discrete axes, if `self$labels` is `derive()` and `self$breaks` is a named vector, use the names as labels.\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\nThis will now work as expected:\n\n```r\np + scale_x_discrete(\n  sec.axis = sec_axis(\n    breaks = c(a = \"One\", b = \"Two\", c = \"Three\")\n    # labels will become c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") unless otherwise set\n  )\n)\n```\n\nWith this patch, the names of `breaks` will be the labels (unless `labels` is explicitly set).  \nThis matches ggplot2's main-axis behaviour.\n\nLet me know if you want even more robust handling or a PR-style patch!",

Here’s how you can approach this using the tidyverse:\n\n**Goal:**  \n- For each `tailnum`, find the proportion of flights with missing `arr_delay`.\n- Only consider `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights.\n- Return the **tailnum with the highest such proportion**.\n\n**Assumption:**  \n- Your example shows all the right columns are present.\n- We're using `flights` data (planes table is not directly needed here).\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = na_arr_delay / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na_arr_delay, total_flights)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `group_by(tailnum)`: Analyze by airplane.\n- `summarize()`: \n  - Count number of flights,\n  - Number of missing arrival delays,\n  - Their proportion.\n- `filter(total_flights >= 100)`: Keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights.\n- `arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))`: Sort so the highest proportion comes first.\n- `slice(1)`: Take the top result.\n- `select(...)`: Show the key results only.\n\n---\n\n**Result**: This will give you the **`tailnum` with the highest share of missing `arr_delay` among those with at least 100 flights**, along with the proportion and the flight count."

Here’s how you can approach this using the tidyverse:\n\n**Goal:**  \n- For each `tailnum`, find the proportion of flights with missing `arr_delay`.\n- Only consider `tailnum`s with at least 100 flights.\n- Return the **tailnum with the highest such proportion**.\n\n**Assumption:**  \n- Your example shows all the right columns are present.\n- We're using `flights` data (planes table is not directly needed here).\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    na_arr_delay = sum(is.na(arr_delay)),\n    prop_na_arr_delay = na_arr_delay / total_flights\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay)) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  select(tailnum, prop_na_arr_delay, total_flights)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `group_by(tailnum)`: Analyze by airplane.\n- `summarize()`: \n  - Count number of flights,\n  - Number of missing arrival delays,\n  - Their proportion.\n- `filter(total_flights >= 100)`: Keep only tailnums with at least 100 flights.\n- `arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))`: Sort so the highest proportion comes first.\n- `slice(1)`: Take the top result.\n- `select(...)`: Show the key results only.\n\n---\n\n**Result**: This will give you the **`tailnum` with the highest share of missing `arr_delay` among those with at least 100 flights**, along with the proportion and the flight count.",

Instead of using a grouped filter to keep only tailnums with >100 flights, it summarizes first (counting total flights) and then filters afterward.\n\n2. For calculating the proportion of NA values, it uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay))/total_flights` rather than `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`. Both approaches are mathematically equivalent, so this is correct.\n\n3. It does arrange in descending order of the proportion as required.\n\nThe submission also adds extra steps that aren't strictly necessary:\n- Using `slice(1)` to get only the top result\n- Using `select()` to show specific columns\n\nWhile these extra steps go beyond the minimal solution, they don't change the correctness of the answer. The core logic is sound: group by tailnum, calculate the proportion of NA arr_delay values, filter for tailnums with at least 100 flights, and find the one with the highest proportion.\n\nThe only technical issue is the order of operations (summarize first, then filter, rather than filter first). This is less efficient but still produces the correct result.\n\nGRADE: P"

Finally arrange to find the highest proportion\n\nThe submitted answer calculates the flight count and then filters, which is equivalent in this case, but doesn't follow the specified approach of using a grouped filter first. The criterion specifically mentions `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)` or the equivalent using `group_by()`.\n\nAdditionally, the calculation method differs slightly. The criterion specifies using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion, while the submission uses `n_na_arr_delay / n_flights`. These are mathematically equivalent but don't match the specified approach.\n\nThe submission also includes additional code to shape the output with `slice(1)` and `select()`, which isn't required but doesn't affect the correctness of the analysis.\n\nWhile the submission would yield correct results, it doesn't follow the specific approach outlined in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P"

It provides correct solution options (using `group_by()` or using `.by =` with the dot)\n\nThe submission comprehensively explains the distinction between `by` and `.by`, provides code examples showing the difference, and emphasizes multiple times that the dot is needed. It even includes a clear summary table that shows `by` is invalid but `.by` is valid (in newer dplyr versions).\n\nThe submission directly addresses the specific issue identified in the criterion and offers the correct solution.\n\nGRADE: C"

Use `rlang::as_name(ensym(dataset))` (if you use tidyverse)\n\nIf you're using tidyverse tools, `rlang` provides a slightly more robust and tidy approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(rlang)\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name,\n  dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (missing(name)) {\n    name <- as_name(ensym(dataset))\n  }\n  # ... rest of your function\n}\n```\n\nThis has advantages (respects tidyverse unquoting etc.) but the base R version works fine for your example.\n\n---\n\n## So your fixed code should be:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (missing(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  # continue with name...\n  print(name)  # for demonstration\n}\n```\n\nAnd then:\n\n```r\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[1] \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\nWorks as desired!\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- [FAQ 7.21 in the R FAQ](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#How-can-I-get-the-name-of-an-object-into-a-function_003f)\n- [`deparse(substitute(.))` and function default arguments](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25244709/603997) by Hadley Wickham\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nUse `name` as a missing argument, compute the default in the body! This ensures the symbolic name makes it in.",

                  "text": "This issue comes from how default arguments are **evaluated** in R function calls. When you write:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n...\n}\n```\n\nthe **default** for `name` gets evaluated **at the time the function is called** – but the value of `dataset` is already bound to the evaluated *object* at that point, not its symbol. So `substitute(dataset)` inside the function body will **not** give you the symbol name as you expect—it gives you the evaluated object.\n\n## The solution: Capture the **call** before evaluation\n\nYou want to capture the symbol passed as `dataset` *before* it is evaluated. To do this, you need to use `substitute()` in the **function body**, not as a default argument.\n\n### Here is a working pattern:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  if (missing(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nWith this pattern:\n\n- If the user provides `name`, it is used.\n- If `name` is missing, you capture the symbol name using `deparse(substitute(dataset))`.\n\n### Example\n\n```r\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- \n  task_create(\n    dataset = simple_addition\n  )\n\nprint(tsk$name) # \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\n## Summary\n\n**Defaulting an argument to the symbol of another argument requires that the default be set _inside_ the function via `if (missing(name)) ...`, not in the argument list.**\n\nA general pattern to follow:\n\n```r\nmy_fun <- function(x, name) {\n  if (missing(name)) name <- deparse(substitute(x))\n  # ...\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Extra note:**  \nIf you need to handle more complex cases (e.g., `dataset = some_list$simple_addition`), `deparse(substitute(dataset))` will return the whole expression (`some_list$simple_addition`). This is usually desirable, but just be aware that's how `substitute` works.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly addresses the issue with the lazy evaluation of the `name` parameter.\n\nThe criterion points out that `name` default is evaluated lazily, and that something in the function causes `dataset` to be evaluated before `name` is. This leads to the issue where `name` contains the deparsed value of the dataset rather than the variable name. The criterion specifically mentions that `name` must be evaluated early in the function using `force(name)`.\n\nLet's analyze the submitted answer:\n\nThe submission correctly identifies that the issue is related to when the default value is evaluated. However, the proposed solution:\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n    if (is.null(name)) {\n        name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThis approach doesn't actually address the lazy evaluation issue mentioned in the criterion.

The criterion suggests that without forcing evaluation, something else in the function causes `dataset` to be evaluated first, which would still lead to the same problem.\n\nThe correct solution would involve something like:\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n    force(name)  # Ensure name is evaluated before dataset is used\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nSince the submission does not address the specific issue of forcing early evaluation of `name` as mentioned in the criterion, it is incorrect.\n\nGRADE: I",

However, while the solution does recommend using `session$ns` instead of `NS(id)` in the server modules, the answer goes beyond this specific criterion.\n\nThe primary focus of the criterion is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules, while `session$ns` ensures proper namespace hierarchy. The submission correctly implements this change in the solution code provided.\n\nThe submission also correctly identifies other important fixes:\n1. Using `ns(\"inner1\")` instead of just `\"inner1\"` when calling the inner module server\n2. Providing fully-qualified namespaced IDs throughout the module chain\n\nThese changes work together with the `session$ns` change to create a complete solution. The submission demonstrates understanding of the fundamental issue described in the criterion.\n\nThe submitted solution would work correctly when implemented and addresses the core issue specified in the criterion about using `session$ns` instead of `NS(id)`.\n\nGRADE: C",

However, while the solution does recommend using `session$ns` instead of `NS(id)` in the server modules, the answer goes beyond this specific criterion.\n\nThe primary focus of the criterion is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules, while `session$ns` ensures proper namespace hierarchy. The submission correctly implements this change in the solution code provided.\n\nThe submission also correctly identifies other important fixes:\n1. Using `ns(\"inner1\")` instead of just `\"inner1\"` when calling the inner module server\n2. Providing fully-qualified namespaced IDs throughout the module chain\n\nThese changes work together with the `session$ns` change to create a complete solution.

This is a classic Shiny *namespacing* gotcha. The UI and outputs are being dynamically generated inside the `renderUI`, but your associated output IDs in `renderText`/`renderPlot` (`output$someTextGenerated`, `output$theChart`) **don't match** the actual namespacing that Shiny expects inside the module.\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\nSuppose your outer id is `\"outer1\"`, and your inner id is `\"inner1\"`, so the **namespace** for an inner module is `\"outer1-inner1-\"`. But **inside that module**, when you write `output$someTextGenerated`, Shiny expects it to match the *UI id* inside that module's namespace. In a `renderUI`, `plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))` expects `output$theChart`, but *inside the current module*, not a child of the parent namespace. In general, the IDs you pass to the output functions should match the actual UI output IDs the module resolves.\n\nBut! Inside `innerServer`, your IDs should be simple, e.g. `output$theChart`. **Don't use `NS()` when you define outputs inside the module**; only use `NS()` when calling outputs in the UI.\n\n---\n\n# The fix\n\n- **NEVER** use `NS()` (or `ns()`) inside a `server` function for outputs. That's only for UI.  \n- So in `innerServer`, set `output$theChart` and `output$someTextGenerated` (not `output$ns(\"theChart\")`).\n\nHere is your **corrected code** with comments:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# The inner UI\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\n# The inner server\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # Don't use ns() on the output names here!\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      # In the UI, use ns() for the generated outputs!\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\n# Outer UI (unchanged)\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\n# Outer server (unchanged)\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n# Explanation\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n- In `server`, use **plain strings**: `output$theChart`\n- In generated UI, use **namespaced ID**: `plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))`\n\nYour working output will now have:\n- the header,\n- the generated verbatimTextOutput, **and**\n- the plot  \n...all appearing as expected in each inner module.\n\n---\n\n## Takeaway\n\n- UI = always use `ns()`\n- Server = never use `ns()` (unless you need to call into a child module, which is rare and advanced)\n- If outputs \"don't appear\", it's *very* often a namespacing mismatch: the UI calls for an output id that isn't found in `output$`.\n\n---\n\n#### Happy Shiny-ing!\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules. Using `session$ns` instead ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nSo, change:\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The UI and outputs are being dynamically generated inside the `renderUI`, but your associated output IDs in `renderText`/`renderPlot` (`output$someTextGenerated`, `output$theChart`) **don't match** the actual namespacing that Shiny expects inside the module.\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\nSuppose your outer id is `\"outer1\"`, and your inner id is `\"inner1\"`, so the **namespace** for an inner module is `\"outer1-inner1-\"`. But **inside that module**, when you write `output$someTextGenerated`, Shiny expects it to match the *UI id* inside that module's namespace. In a `renderUI`, `plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))` expects `output$theChart`, but *inside the current module*, not a child of the parent namespace. In general, the IDs you pass to the output functions should match the actual UI output IDs the module resolves.\n\nBut! Inside `innerServer`, your IDs should be simple, e.g. `output$theChart`. **Don't use `NS()` when you define outputs inside the module**; only use `NS()` when calling outputs in the UI.\n\n---\n\n# The fix\n\n- **NEVER** use `NS()` (or `ns()`) inside a `server` function for outputs.

How to fix\n\nYou need to ensure that **the same namespaced id is used in both `inner_UI()` and `innerServer()`**.\n\n**Solution:**  \nIn `outerServer`, use `ns(\"inner1\")` instead of `\"inner1\"`.\n\n```r\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns    # get the namespacing function for *this instance*\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n```\nNotice:  \n- Use `session$ns` inside the *moduleServer*; don't redeclare `ns <- NS(id)`!\n\n### Final (working) code\n\nHere is your corrected (minimal) example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(session$ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(session$ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner1\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner2\"))\n    innerServer(ns(\"inner3\"))\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaway**\n\n**Always use the same (fully namespaced) id in both UI and server calls for modules!**  \nUse `session$ns()` in the server part of a module to handle nesting.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want further clarification about why this is needed or about module nesting in general!",

                  "text": "Let's clarify what's happening and why you're seeing that error.\n\n## What's Happening\n\n- Your package's **DESCRIPTION** says it needs a package called `spatialstuff`.\n- Under `Remotes:` you say to get it from `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- But the Github repo is **org/spatial-Stuff** (note the dash and the capital S).\n- When your package is built (such as by pkgdown's CI workflow), one of the first steps is to install your dependencies using the names declared in DESCRIPTION.\n\n### How does R resolve this?\n\n1. `Imports: spatialstuff` means \"Install a package that is named **spatialstuff**.\"\n2. `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` means \"To find the **spatialstuff** package, look for a repo at org/spatial-Stuff (on GitHub), and expect it to contain a package called **spatialstuff**.\"\n\nThe key thing: \n- **The name in Imports must match the Package: field in that repo's DESCRIPTION, not the repo's name.**  \n- But when pak (the install tool used in most R GitHub Actions/CI these days) tries to fetch `spatialstuff`, it goes to the repo you told it, and looks for a **spatialstuff** package.\n\n## What Could Be Wrong\n\n### 1. Mismatch between Repo Name and Package Name\n\nThis is **fine for Remotes**—the package registry supports this. Example:\n- Repo: `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- Inside that, file DESCRIPTION: `Package: spatialstuff`\n\nBut **if the package is named differently**—e.g., `spatial-Stuff` in DESCRIPTION, but you refer to it as `spatialstuff` in your Imports, that's a problem.\n\n### 2. The package doesn't build or isn't found\n\n- If the repo **does not actually contain an R package** (missing DESCRIPTION)\n- If the `Package:` in that repo's DESCRIPTION is not `spatialstuff`, but something else (like `spatial-Stuff`)\n- If there is a typo or case mismatch in the name (`spatialstuff` vs. `spatialstuff`, should be case-insensitive on most systems but not on all)\n\n### 3. The install tool (pak) can't locate it\n\n- If the spelling/capitalization between the Declared Imports, Remotes, and actual repo/package is inconsistent, installation will fail.\n\n## Diagnosing Your Error\n\nThe error message:\n\n```\nCould not solve package dependencies:\ndeps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff\n* spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\n\nmeans:  \n`pak` could **not find any package named `spatialstuff`** in the declared `Remotes`.\n\n**This ALMOST ALWAYS means that there is a mismatch between:**\n\n- The name you put in the `Imports` (needs to match the package name)\n- The actual package name as declared in the remote repo's `DESCRIPTION`\n- The Remotes line, which only controls where to look\n\n## What You Should Do\n\n1. **Go to the github.com/org/spatial-Stuff repo.**  \n   Open its `DESCRIPTION`.  \n   Find the `Package:` field.\n\n2. **Make sure you put that exact name in YOUR DESCRIPTION under Imports.**\n\n   Example:  \n   ```r\n   Package: spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n   Then you must use:  \n   ```\n   Imports:\n     spatial-Stuff\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n\n**It (Imports:) must match the name in the *other* repo's DESCRIPTION file.**\n\n**Double check: Both are lowercase? Both have same punctuation?**\n\n3. **Remotes can point to any repo.**  \n   The actual *repo name* does not matter, only where to find the package code.\n\n4. **If the package in `org/spatial-Stuff` is truly named `spatialstuff`, your usage is correct.**  \n   - If not, correct your Imports/Remotes.\n\n5. **Optionally, use `pak::pkg_install('org/spatial-Stuff')` locally** to debug and see the exact error.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Check if the package name (`Package:` in DESCRIPTION of the remote repo) matches what you wrote in Imports.**\n- The repo name and the package name don't have to match, but the package name *must*.\n- The error you see is **almost always** caused by a typo or case/punctuation mismatch.\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nIf the remote `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` says:\n\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nyou want:\n\n```\nImports: spatial-Stuff\nRemotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nIf it says:\n\n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\n\nthen your config is correct, **assuming everything else is working**.\n\n## **References**\n\n- [R Packages - Remotes](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#github-packages)\n- [devtools::install_github() documentation](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html)\n\n---\n\nIf you **post the exact content** of the `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION`, I can tell you the line to use!",

If the name doesn’t match, ask the maintainer to fix it, or change your `Imports:` to match (though this may confuse users).**\n\n---\n\n#### Related References\n\n- [R Packages - Remotes Field](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#remotes)\n- [CRAN Policy - Package Names](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#naming)\n- [Common pak/devtools install issue](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1728)\n\n---\n\nIf you reply with the actual `Package:` line from `org/spatial-Stuff`'s DESCRIPTION, I can suggest an exact fix!\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Your `Imports:` value  | Their `DESCRIPTION` | Result                                 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| spatialstuff          | spatialstuff        | ✅ OK                                   |\n| spatialstuff          | spatial-Stuff       | ❌ Fail                                 |\n| spatial-Stuff         | spatial-Stuff       | ✅ OK *(but confusing, and non-CRAN)*   |\n| spatialstuff          | SpatialStuff        | ❌ Fail                                 |\n\n\n**Always match the case and spelling of the dependency’s `Package:` field!**\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

It also offers several solutions:\n\n1. Ask maintainers to ensure the `Package:` line matches the Imports name\n2. Change the user's Imports to match the dependency's Package name\n3. Fork the repo and fix the name\n4. Tell users to manually install the dependency\n\nHowever, the submission does not specifically mention the solution required by the criterion - using the `<package>=` prefix syntax in the Remotes field. The correct format would be:\n\n```\nRemotes:\n    spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\nThis specific syntax would tell R's package management system that the package with name \"spatialstuff\" should be installed from the GitHub repository \"org/spatial-Stuff\", even though the repository name doesn't match the package name.\n\nSince the submission doesn't mention this particular syntax that would solve the problem according to the criterion, despite otherwise being informative about package naming issues, it doesn't meet the specific criterion.\n\nGRADE: I"

If the **package’s name as declared in the repo’s DESCRIPTION file is not `\"spatialstuff\"` (all lower)**  \nfor example, maybe it is called `\"spatial-Stuff\"` or `\"spatial_stuff\"` explicitly, or has mismatched case  \nthen R will refuse to load it as `\"spatialstuff\"`.\n\n**On install, pak/devtools/friends:**\n- Will clone/fetch `org/spatial-Stuff`\n- Look for its `DESCRIPTION`\n    - If its `Package:` field says `spatialstuff` (lowercase, matching your `Imports:`) -- fine!\n    - If not (e.g. `spatial-Stuff`, camel case, etc.) -- dependency error, “can’t find dependency spatialstuff”.\n\n---\n\n### How to Diagnose\n\n1. **Go to https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff and check the `DESCRIPTION` file.**  \n    Look at the `Package:` line.\n\n    - Is it `Package: spatialstuff`?  \n        - ✅ Problem is something else  \n    - Is it `Package: spatial-Stuff`?  \n        - 🚫 That will NOT satisfy `Imports: spatialstuff` (R is case sensitive)\n\n---\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Best:** Ask the maintainers to ensure that the `Package:` line in `DESCRIPTION` is spelled `spatialstuff` in all lower case (matching your `Imports:` line, and what R expects).\n\n2. **Workaround:**\n   - In your own DESCRIPTION, you **must** use whatever name is in their `Package:` line (case-sensitive!).\n       - e.g. if theirs is `spatial-Stuff`, you must use `spatial-Stuff`.\n   - However, this is frowned upon, and could cause confusion for your users.\n\n3. **If you have no control, and must ship (and the name mismatch is the issue):**\n   - Mirror (fork) the repo and fix the `Package:` name yourself, use your own remote instead in `Remotes:` *(not ideal or sustainable)*.\n   - Tell your users to manually install the dependency (`remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`) *before* they install your package.\n\n4. **Note on `Remotes`:**\n   - It is *not* enough to specify the GitHub repo—**the DESCRIPTION’s `Package:` line must match what you write in your Imports** case-sensitively!\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n> **This is NOT your fault!**\n>\n> The root issue is the **mismatch between your `Imports:` line and the actual package name declared by the other package’s own `DESCRIPTION` file.**\n>\n> - R is strict: the package is found by `Package:` exactly.\n> - The name in your `DESCRIPTION` must match the other package’s `Package:` exactly (case, spelling).\n> - Most likely, the dependency package's `DESCRIPTION` says `Package: spatial-Stuff` (with dash and/or upper-case), but you are importing `spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n**Check the dependency’s `DESCRIPTION` file. If the name doesn’t match, ask the maintainer to fix it, or change your `Imports:` to match (though this may confuse users).**\n\n---\n\n#### Related References\n\n- [R Packages - Remotes Field](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-in-practice.html#remotes)\n- [CRAN Policy - Package Names](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#naming)\n- [Common pak/devtools install issue](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1728)\n\n---\n\nIf you reply with the actual `Package:` line from `org/spatial-Stuff`'s DESCRIPTION, I can suggest an exact fix!\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table**\n\n| Your `Imports:` value  | Their `DESCRIPTION` | Result                                 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| spatialstuff          | spatialstuff        | ✅ OK                                   |\n| spatialstuff          | spatial-Stuff       | ❌ Fail                                 |\n| spatial-Stuff         | spatial-Stuff       | ✅ OK *(but confusing, and non-CRAN)*   |\n| spatialstuff          | SpatialStuff        | ❌ Fail                                 |\n\n\n**Always match the case and spelling of the dependency’s `Package:` field!**",

But this is not recommended and brittle.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Remotes entry         | Repo           | Package name in DESCRIPTION | Your Imports | Will work? |\n|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|--------------|------------|\n| org/spatial-Stuff     | spatial-Stuff  | spatial-Stuff              | spatial-Stuff| Yes (hacks needed, but not best practice) |\n| org/spatial-Stuff     | spatial-Stuff  | spatialstuff               | spatialstuff | Yes        |\n| org/spatial-Stuff     | spatialstuff   | spatialstuff               | spatialstuff | Yes        |\n| org/spatialstuff      | spatialstuff   | spatialstuff               | spatialstuff | Yes        |\n\n---\n\n## **In summary:**\n\n- **If `spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff` are not the same (including case/dash differences), R treats them as different packages.**\n- The only way to solve this cleanly is for the remote repo to have `Package: spatialstuff` in its DESCRIPTION (no dash, all-lowercase).\n- If you can't fix the remote dependency, you *have* to use whatever casing they used, with all the associated issues.\n- This is not a failure of your pkgdown setup—**this is a problem with the naming of the dependency package.**\n\n---\n\n### **Links for reference:**\n\n- [R Package Naming Rules (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Package-names)\n- [pak::pak() fails if package name and repo differ](https://github.com/r-lib/pak/issues/375)\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n**User error:** No, but the error is downstream.  \n**Direct cause:** The dependency's package name (in its DESCRIPTION) and your reference to it must **match exactly**, including case and dashes, and should be all-lowercase.  \n**Solution:** Ask the upstream to fix their package name, or match your dependency reference _exactly_ to what they use (not recommended, but that's R's rules).\n\n---\n\nIf you share the actual repo or DESCRIPTION file of the dependency, I can advise more specifically!\n***\n[Criterion]: The user needs to specify the package name explicitly in the Remotes `DESCRIPTION` field using a `<package>=` prefix, e.g. `spatialstuff=org/spatial-Stuff`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

But this is not recommended and brittle.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Remotes entry         | Repo           | Package name in DESCRIPTION | Your Imports | Will work? |\n|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|--------------|------------|\n| org/spatial-Stuff     | spatial-Stuff  | spatial-Stuff              | spatial-Stuff| Yes (hacks needed, but not best practice) |\n| org/spatial-Stuff     | spatial-Stuff  | spatialstuff               | spatialstuff | Yes        |\n| org/spatial-Stuff     | spatialstuff   | spatialstuff               | spatialstuff | Yes        |\n| org/spatialstuff      | spatialstuff   | spatialstuff               | spatialstuff | Yes        |\n\n---\n\n## **In summary:**\n\n- **If `spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff` are not the same (including case/dash differences), R treats them as different packages.**\n- The only way to solve this cleanly is for the remote repo to have `Package: spatialstuff` in its DESCRIPTION (no dash, all-lowercase).\n- If you can't fix the remote dependency, you *have* to use whatever casing they used, with all the associated issues.\n- This is not a failure of your pkgdown setup—**this is a problem with the naming of the dependency package.**\n\n---\n\n### **Links for reference:**\n\n- [R Package Naming Rules (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Package-names)\n- [pak::pak() fails if package name and repo differ](https://github.com/r-lib/pak/issues/375)\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n**User error:** No, but the error is downstream.  \n**Direct cause:** The dependency's package name (in its DESCRIPTION) and your reference to it must **match exactly**, including case and dashes, and should be all-lowercase.  \n**Solution:** Ask the upstream to fix their package name, or match your dependency reference _exactly_ to what they use (not recommended, but that's R's rules).\n\n---\n\nIf you share the actual repo or DESCRIPTION file of the dependency, I can advise more specifically!",

Let's break it down.\n\n## **What's Happening?**\n- In `Parent$initialize()`, you *dynamically* assign `self[[\"foo\"]]`.\n- In `Child`, you try to *override* `foo` *statically*.\n- On construction, it tries to set `self[[\"foo\"]]` **then** R6 tries to bind the static child method. But the name `foo` has already been bound---and R6's field locking mechanism causes:  \n  ```\n  Error in self$foo <- function() { : \n    cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'\n  ```\n  (even with `lock_objects = FALSE`, some locking still occurs during class assembly).\n\n---\n\n## **Best Practice & Solutions**\n\n### **1. Prefer Static Methods in R6**\nIf you want a method to be inheritable & overridable, **define it directly in `public = ...`**, *not* dynamically in `$initialize`.\n\n**Rewrite `Parent` as:**\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print('...and bar!')\n    }\n  )\n)\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n#> [1] \"...and bar!\"\n```\nThis is the recommended approach for inheritable methods.\n\n### **2.

                  "text": "Let's analyze what's happening and **why you're seeing the error**:\n\n---\n\n## Problem Breakdown\n\n### What you did\n\n- In the `Parent` R6 class, in the `initialize` function, you dynamically assign a new method:\n  ```r\n  self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"foo\")\n  ```\n- In the `Child` class, you try to override `foo` in the class definition:\n  ```r\n  foo = function() super$foo()\n  ```\n- On creating a `Child` object, you get:\n  ```\n  Error in self$foo <- function() { :  cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## Why is this Happening?\n\n1. **R6 method bindings are locked by default:** When you declare `foo` in the class definition (`public = list(foo = ...)`), the **binding for `foo` is created and locked** on the R6 object.\n2. In `Parent`'s `initialize`, you try to **overwrite** `self[[\"foo\"]]`, which is not allowed when the binding is locked—even if you used `lock_objects = FALSE` (which affects methods, not objects' bindings).\n3. **Both static and dynamic binding for a method can't easily coexist:** If you declare `foo` in the `public` list and also assign to `self[[\"foo\"]]`, you will get an error because trying to overwrite a locked binding is illegal.\n\n---\n\n## How to Fix It\n\nYou have **two primary options** depending on intent:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Avoid dynamic assignment, only define methods in public list**\n\nIf you want to support inheritance and method-overriding, **always define public methods in the class definition**, not inside `initialize`. Do this:\n\n#### Parent definition (No dynamic assignment)\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print(\"child\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new() # works\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n#> [1] \"child\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Support dynamic assignment by NOT declaring the method in `public` list**\n\n- Don't declare `foo` in the `public` section of either class.\n- Only assign `foo` dynamically via `initialize` if you *don't* intend to override via inheritance.\n- This approach **removes the ability to use super** for `foo`, since it's not defined statically.\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"dynamic foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  lock_objects = FALSE,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() print(\"child dynamic foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"child dynamic foo\"\n```\n**Notice:** Now, `foo` can be reassigned in `initialize` for both classes, but you CANNOT use `super$foo()`, as the dynamic method does not participate in the superclass method mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach | Where to define `foo` | Can Child override? | Can use `super$foo()`? |\n| :---- | :------------------ | :------------------ | :------------------- |\n| Static | in `public` list   | Yes                 | Yes                  |\n| Dynamic | in `initialize` via `self[[\"foo\"]]` | Yes, but manually; cannot access super | No |\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n\n**For easy inheritance and super calls, always define methods in the `public` list, not via dynamic assignment.**\n\n**So, change your `Parent` class to:**\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() print(\"foo\")\n  )\n)\n```\nAnd `Child` as before.\n\n---\n\n### **If you really need dynamic assignment, do NOT declare a method named `foo` in the class (in either Parent or Child), and do all method assignments dynamically—accepting the limitations.**\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- R6 documentation: [https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html)\n- See `lock_objects` and method overriding sections.\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n**Don't assign to `self[[\"foo\"]]` if you already have a `foo` in `public`. Define your method in the class, not in `initialize`, for inheritance to work correctly.**",

This leads to an **evaluation order cycle** (hence, the error about \"promise already under evaluation\").\n\nLet's look closer at your code:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nNotice:\n- In the inner function, `chat = chat` means: by default, use the argument `chat`, which is itself. That creates a recursion/cycle in evaluation.\n\n## How to Fix\n\n**You want the inner function's default for `chat` to be the one passed to `generate`.**\nBut writing `chat = chat` doesn’t do that (and never has in R functions). Instead, you should use a default of `NULL`, and then set it inside the function if it's `NULL`.\n\n### Solution:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat = NULL) {\n    if (is.null(chat)) chat <- get(\"chat\", envir = parent.env(environment()))\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nBut there is an **easier, recommended** way: **Closure capture**.

                  "text": "Certainly! Here's how you would translate your code to a single call to `cli::cli_abort()`, with correct pluralization and proper use of glue syntax:\n\n```r\ncli::cli_abort(\n  \"The workflow has argument{?s} to be tuned that are missing some parameter object{?s}: {missing}.\",\n  missing = paste0(\"'\", pset$id[!params], \"'\", collapse = \", \"),\n  .envir = environment()\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Pluralization with `{?s}`:** This automatically makes the message say \"argument\" or \"arguments\", and \"object\" or \"objects\" depending on how many things are missing.\n- **`missing` argument:** This is passed to the glue string as `{missing}`, which is a character string of the missing parameter IDs, each wrapped in `'...'` and separated by commas.\n- **`cli::cli_abort()`**: Communicates intent clearly, and uses nice formatting for the error.\n- **`.envir = environment()`**: Ensures that `cli` can evaluate `pset`, `params`, etc. in your current environment (optional but good practice inside functions).\n\n#### If you want smart pluralization, you should also provide a variable for the count, for example:\n\n```r\ncli::cli_abort(\n  \"The workflow has argument{?s} to be tuned that are missing some parameter object{?s}: {missing}.\",\n  n = sum(!params),\n  missing = paste0(\"'\", pset$id[!params], \"'\", collapse = \", \")\n)\n```\n\nWith `{?s}` in `cli`, the plural/singular is chosen based on the value of `n`.\n\n**Final version (with explicit count variable):**\n```r\ncli::cli_abort(\n  \"The workflow has argument{?s} to be tuned that are missing some parameter object{?s}: {missing}.\",\n  n = sum(!params),\n  missing = paste0(\"'\", pset$id[!params], \"'\", collapse = \", \")\n)\n```\n\n**This is the recommended snippet to use.**",

They also properly created named arguments for string interpolation rather than concatenating strings.\n\nThe expected solution uses a slightly different pluralization syntax with `{?/an}` and `{?is/are}`, and it uses `{.val {pset$id[!params]}}` to display the values, while the submission defines a `missing` variable. However, these are stylistic differences, and the submission still meets all the core requirements listed in the criterion.\n\nThe only minor difference is how the values are displayed. The submission uses a custom variable while the criterion example uses direct value styling with `{.val {}}`, but this is a minor stylistic difference rather than a functional error.\n\nGRADE: C",

Your error boils down to scoping, **where your reactive and output code is being defined**, and missing the proper server logic.

Otherwise, Shiny can't find them!\n\n---\n\n### **Here's how you fix your app:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data (outside server is OK)\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # 'input$condition' and 'input$visit_threshold' are already reactive!\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n\n    data <- filtered_data()\n\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) return(NULL)\n\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Notes on What Was Fixed**\n\n1. **Moved the `reactive` and `renderPlot` code inside the `server` function.**\n2. **No need to wrap `input$condition` or `input$visit_threshold` in their own `reactive` Expressions.**  \n    Shiny inputs (`input$foo`) are already reactive.\n3. **Check for empty data in the plot.** If the filter removes all rows, `lm()` and `ggplot()` will fail.  \n4. **`output$plot` is defined inside server, not referenced as a value being passed to `shinyApp`.**\n5. **Filtering logic:** Use `== input$condition` not `== ckd_condition`. `ckd_condition` is not defined.\n\n---\n\n## **Takeaway**\nStructural rules of Shiny: all code that references `input`/`output`/`reactive`/`render*` must be inside the `server` function.  \nPass just `ui` and your `server` function to `shinyApp()`.\n\n**Try the fixed version above, and your error will be gone!**",

The solution suggested in the submission properly moves all the reactive code into the server function.\n\nThe submission correctly explains:\n1. The cause of the \"Can't read output 'plot'\" error\n2. That all server-side code using input/output/reactive must be inside the server function\n3. Provides a complete solution with the proper organization of code\n4. Simplified the reactive expressions by directly using input$condition rather than creating unnecessary intermediate reactive variables\n5. Properly structured the shinyApp() call\n\nThis solution aligns with the criterion, which also identifies the need to move the output$plot and rendering code into a proper server function. The submission even goes a bit beyond by cleaning up other aspects of the code and providing a clear explanation of what went wrong.\n\nGRADE: C",

This means your `output$plot` object is not correctly assigned—**because all your `reactive` and `renderPlot` code is not inside the `server` function.** In Shiny, all server-side code that uses `input`, `output`, and `reactive` values must go inside the `server` function.\n\n## **What you did**\n- You declared all `reactive` expressions and `renderPlot` *outside* the server function.\n- Then inside the server function, you just wrote `output$plot` which does nothing.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix it**\n\n### **Move all server-side code inside `server`**\n\nHere's how your code should be structured:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) return(NULL)\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Key changes**\n- **All reactive expressions and render functions go inside the server function.**\n- You do NOT need to define `ckd_condition <- reactive({ ... })` and then use `ckd_condition` in a filter with `== ckd_condition`.

Simplified the reactive expressions by directly using input$condition rather than creating unnecessary intermediate reactive variables\n5. Properly structured the shinyApp() call\n\nThis solution aligns with the criterion, which also identifies the need to move the output$plot and rendering code into a proper server function.

Currently, you're placing all your reactive logic and `output$plot` **outside** the `server` function, and then telling Shiny to run with:\n\n```r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input, output) {\n  output$plot\n})\n```\nBut `output$plot` is not a function—it's not even defined in that context. This causes Shiny to fail when it tries to access it.\n\n**In Shiny, all server-side logic (reactives, outputs, etc.) must be defined _inside_ the `server` function.**\n\n## Solution\n\n**1.

To replace the first `||` with `\"T\"` and the second `||` with `\"A\"` in `appointment_key` using **tidyverse** tools, you can use [`str_replace`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_replace.html) and [`str_replace`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_replace.html) again for the next match. Here's the workflow:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result = appointment_key %>%\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%      # Replace the first ||\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\")          # Replace the next ||\n  )\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  referral_key appointment_key result      \n  <chr>        <chr>           <chr>       \n1 OP3349021    4289||10410||1  4289T10410A1\n2 OP3359764    4289||10410||2  4289T10410A2\n```\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- `str_replace()` replaces only **the first** occurrence in the string, so calling it twice replaces the two separate `||`s with your desired letters.\n\nIf you need this for arbitrary numbers of replacements (or more complex rules), consider using `str_split` and `str_c`, but for this fixed pattern, the above is simplest.\n***\n[Criterion]: Call `str_replace()` twice, once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second:\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# replace pipes\npipe <- pipe |> \n  mutate(\n    # first instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'T'\n    ),\n    # second instance of ||\n    appointment_key = str_replace(\n      string = appointment_key,\n      pattern = '\\\\|\\\\|',\n      replacement = 'A'\n    ),\n    # optional: test for equivalence\n    equivalent = appointment_key == result\n  )\n```\n\nNotably, `str_replace()` should be called twice, in order. The solution should not use `str_replace_all()`. Using `||` for the `pattern` is fine as long as `fixed = TRUE`. A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

This is essentially a **semi-join** operation in the tidyverse.\n\n### Using dplyr's [`semi_join()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html):\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- `semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))` keeps only the rows in `df2` that have a matching key combination in `df1`, **but keeps all other columns from `df2`**.\n\n---\n\n### Full Example\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf1 <- data.frame(\n  key1= c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'),\n  key2= c(1, 2, 3, 4),\n  var3= 11:14,\n  var4= letters[1:4]\n)\ndf2 <- data.frame(\n  key1= c('a', 'b', 'e', 'f'),\n  key2= c(1, 2, 4, 5),\n  var3= 21:24,\n  var4= letters[5:8]\n)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n\nprint(common_df)\n```\n**Output:**\n```\n  key1 key2 var3 var4\n1    a    1   21    e\n2    b    2   22    f\n```\n\n---\n\n### For Reference\n\n- If you want all columns from both, use `inner_join()` -- but that includes all columns from both data frames and is more like an SQL join.\n\n- In your need, `semi_join()` is ideal.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n```r\ncommon_df <- df2 %>% semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\",\"key2\"))\n```\nThat gives you the subset of `df2` whose specified keys are present in `df1`.",

In the tidyverse, the ideal function for this is [`semi_join`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html), which keeps all rows in `df2` that have a matching pair in `df1` for the columns you specify.\n\nHere's how you do it:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `semi_join(df2, df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))` returns all rows of `df2` where values of `key1` and `key2` match a pair in `df1`.\n- It does *not* bring columns from `df1` (unlike `inner_join`).\n\n---\n\n### Minimal Working Example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf1 <- data.frame(\n  key1 = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'),\n  key2 = c(1, 2, 3, 4),\n  var3 = 1:4,\n  var4 = 11:14\n)\n\ndf2 <- data.frame(\n  key1 = c('a', 'b', 'e', 'f'),\n  key2 = c(1, 2, 4, 5),\n  var3 = 21:24,\n  var4 = 31:34\n)\n\ncommon_df <- df2 %>%\n  semi_join(df1, by = c(\"key1\", \"key2\"))\nprint(common_df)\n#>   key1 key2 var3 var4\n#> 1    a    1   21   31\n#> 2    b    2   22   32\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nUse `semi_join()` from dplyr with your key columns!",

In **testthat v3**, you should use the `expect_snapshot()` or `expect_snapshot_warning()` helpers for output and warnings, and the new \"edition\" guides you toward using `.value =` and `.expect =` arguments for clearer test structure. You can learn more in the [testthat 3rd edition upgrade guide](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html).\n\nYour example aims to check that the warning with a specific message is produced when calling code.\n\nHere’s how you could rewrite your test for **testthat 3rd edition**:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"unsupported argument triggers warning\", {\n  expect_snapshot_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    class = NA  # allows matching warning text rather than type\n  )\n})\n```\n\nThis will snapshot the warning text and fail if the text ever changes (that's the default 3rd edition behavior).\n\nIf you want to match the *contents* of the warning specifically (rather than snapshotting), use `expect_warning()` as before, but the syntax largely remains:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"unsupported argument triggers specific warning\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy\\\\(\\\\)` method for `boop` objects\"\n  )\n})\n```\n\nNotice that in the 3rd edition, you don't need extra backslashes (to double-escape backticks) if using string matching, but you might keep them for safe regex interpretation. You can also use `fixed = TRUE` to match literally:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"unsupported argument triggers specific warning\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\",\n    fixed = TRUE\n  )\n})\n```\n\nTo summarize:  \n- Wrap your test in `test_that()`.  \n- If you're matching the warning text, you can use `expect_warning()` as before, optionally with `fixed = TRUE` for literal matches.  \n- If you're snapshotting (preferred in edition 3), use `expect_snapshot_warning()`.  \n\n**Pick which approach best suits your maintenance and specificity needs!**\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \nhttps://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_warning.html  \nhttps://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html"

You can also use `fixed = TRUE` to match literally:\n\n```r\ntest_that(\"unsupported argument triggers specific warning\", {\n  expect_warning(\n    check_ellipses(\"exponentiate\", \"tidy\", \"boop\", exponentiate = TRUE, quick = FALSE),\n    \"`exponentiate` argument is not supported in the `tidy()` method for `boop` objects\",\n    fixed = TRUE\n  )\n})\n```\n\nTo summarize:  \n- Wrap your test in `test_that()`.  \n- If you're matching the warning text, you can use `expect_warning()` as before, optionally with `fixed = TRUE` for literal matches.  \n- If you're snapshotting (preferred in edition 3), use `expect_snapshot_warning()`.  \n\n**Pick which approach best suits your maintenance and specificity needs!**\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \nhttps://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/expect_warning.html  \nhttps://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html",

Let's break down the problem:\n\n### What happened?\n\nYou wrote:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x +1, .names = \"x\",))\n```\n\nand got an error related to how you used `across()` (and possibly some copy-paste encoding issue at the bottom, but let's ignore that for now).\n\n---\n\n### Problems in your code\n\n#### 1. `.names = \"x\",`\n- `across()`'s `.names` argument tells what the *new* column name(s) should be.\n- `\"x\"` will literally name the result `\"x\"`. Usually, you want to keep the column name or use the `{.col}` template.\n\n#### 2. Extra comma\n- The comma after `.names = \"x\",` is not needed (and may cause issues).\n\n#### 3.

Let's break down the problem:\n\n### What happened?\n\nYou wrote:\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x +1, .names = \"x\",))\n```\n\nand got an error related to how you used `across()` (and possibly some copy-paste encoding issue at the bottom, but let's ignore that for now).\n\n---\n\n### Problems in your code\n\n#### 1. `.names = \"x\",`\n- `across()`'s `.names` argument tells what the *new* column name(s) should be.\n- `\"x\"` will literally name the result `\"x\"`. Usually, you want to keep the column name or use the `{.col}` template.\n\n#### 2. Extra comma\n- The comma after `.names = \"x\",` is not needed (and may cause issues).\n\n#### 3. Not updating the existing column (or naming new column unintentionally)\n- If you want to overwrite `vs`, you should not change its name.\n\n#### 4. Using `across()` for a single column\n- `across()` is mainly for multiple columns, but you \"can\" use it for one. But for clarity, just use `mutate(vs = vs + 1)` if you only want to change one column.\n\n---\n\n### How to fix\n\n#### **If you want to increment `vs` in place:**\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n```\n\n#### **If you want a _new_ variable, say `vs_plus1`, use `.names`:**\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n# This creates a new column called vs_plus1\n```\n\n#### **If you want to use base R function:**\n\n```r\nmtcars |> mutate(vs_plus1 = vs + 1)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Full working example\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Increment existing vs:\nmtcars |> mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n\n# Or, add new vs_plus1:\nmtcars |> mutate(vs_plus1 = vs + 1)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- Remove the comma after `.names`.\n- Use `.names = \"{.col}_new\"` to set new column names dynamically.\n- Use `mutate(vs = vs + 1)` for modifying a single column.\n- Only use `across()` for multiple columns, or use it carefully if you want to programmatically mutate one column.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you have more questions!**",

Your `.names = \"x\"` will literally make the new column just \"x\".  \n2. **Comma after `.names`**: There's an unnecessary comma after `.names = \"x\"`, which could potentially cause parsing errors.\n3. **Anonymous function syntax**: While `\\(x) x + 1` is valid in recent R versions (`R >= 4.1.0`), some environments can be picky, so you might want to use `function(x) x + 1` for better compatibility.\n4. **across() with single column**: If you want to mutate just one column, prefer using `mutate(vs = vs + 1)`, but if you want to use `across()`, it makes more sense with multiple columns.\n5. **'栀Ƭ' error**: That’s almost certainly a side-effect of some previous error or copy-paste/wrong encoding, and should disappear after you fix the above.\n\n## Fixed code\n\nIf you want to add 1 to the `vs` column and create a new column (say `vs_plus1`):\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(across(vs, ~ .x + 1, .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"))\n```\n\nIf you just want to overwrite `vs` with `vs + 1`, don't use `across`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(vs = vs + 1)\n```\n\nIf you want to create a single column called \"x\", you can do:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(x = vs + 1)\n```\n\n### General tip\n\n- `across()` is most helpful when you want to refer to **multiple columns** at once.\n\n## Summary of Correct Syntax\n\n**With `across()` (multiple columns or want to use its naming):**\n\n```r\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(across(\n    vs,\n    ~ .x + 1,\n    .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"  # Results in \"vs_plus1\"\n  ))\n```\n\n**Direct mutation:**\n\n```r\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(newcol = vs + 1)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Your specific fix\n\nTo concentrate just on your example, this would work:\n\n```r\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(across(\n    vs,\n    \\(x) x + 1,\n    .names = \"x\"\n  ))\n```\n\nBut this will add a new column called \"x\" with `vs + 1`. Make sure:\n\n- No trailing commas.\n- Use curly braces/format in `.names` if you want to append to the original name.\n\n**Preferred universal fix:**\n\n```r\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(across(\n    vs,\n    ~ .x + 1,\n    .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"\n  ))\n```\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Remove the extra comma.\n- Use correct `.names` template.\n- Use `function(x) ...` or `~ .x + 1` for maximum compatibility if `\\(x) ...` gives you trouble.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a trailing comma after `.names = \"x\"` that needs to be removed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Make sure:\n\n- No trailing commas.\n- Use curly braces/format in `.names` if you want to append to the original name.\n\n**Preferred universal fix:**\n\n```r\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(across(\n    vs,\n    ~ .x + 1,\n    .names = \"{.col}_plus1\"\n  ))\n```\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Remove the extra comma.\n- Use correct `.names` template.\n- Use `function(x) ...` or `~ .x + 1` for maximum compatibility if `\\(x) ...` gives you trouble.",

                  "text": "You are correct that `dplyr::closest()` triggers  \n```Error: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'```\n\nThis means that **`closest()` is not an exported function from dplyr**. In dplyr, several internal or developer-facing helpers are not exported in the standard namespace, even if they are available within dplyr's own code. Sometimes they get attached to your search path when you call `library(dplyr)`, but they're not meant for official user consumption.\n\n## Why does `closest()` work unqualified?\n- It might work in your package because something else (perhaps dplyr or one of its dependencies) is attaching or importing it into your namespace.\n- This is fragile and **not robust for package development**.\n\n## How do you fix it?\n\n### 1. **Don't use internal/non-exported functions from dplyr**\nIf possible, **avoid using such functions.** They're internal for a reason and could break/change without warning.\n\n### 2. **Copy the source if stable/reasonable**\n- If you inspect `dplyr:::closest`, and it's small & self-contained, you might consider copying the function definition into your package (with attribution).\n\n### 3. **Import it explicitly (not recommended for CRAN packages)**\nYou _can_ use triple-colon to access it: `dplyr:::closest()`, but:\n- This is not recommended for packages you intend to share/submit to CRAN.\n- If you do this, you can't import it in your NAMESPACE (since it's not exported). It's a hack.\n- Lint tools and R CMD check will often complain about use of `:::` in packages.\n\n### 4. **Implement your own version (recommended)**\nFor many simple tasks (e.g., finding the index/value closest to something), it's best to write your own. For example, if you wanted the index of the vector element closest to a value:\n\n```r\nwhich_closest <- function(x, value) {\n  which.min(abs(x - value))\n}\n```\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Method         | Usage        | Safe for packages? | Drawbacks                        |\n|---------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| dplyr::closest | Not exported | No                | Error, not possible              |\n| dplyr:::closest| Works        | No                | Internal; fragile; not for CRAN  |\n| Copy code      | Works        | Yes               | Must maintain/attribute          |\n| Your own       | Works        | Yes               | Must test for your needs         |\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n**Copy dplyr:::closest function (if that's okay license-wise and for your needs) into your package** or **write your own equivalent**.  \n**Do not use `dplyr::closest` or `dplyr:::closest` in package code you intend to publish or share.**\n\nIf you show your specific use of `closest`, I can help write an equivalent function!\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n- [CRAN Policy: \"Do not use ::: in packages.\"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cran-logs/policies.html)\n- [Hadley Wickham on non-exported/internal functions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17351125/use-of-the-triple-colon)\n\n---\n\n**Example alternative:**  \nIf using for numeric search:\n```r\nclosest <- function(x, target) {\n  x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n}\n```\nYou can adapt this to work just how you need.

Exported functions are those you can use with `package::function()` syntax; unexported ones are internal helpers and not officially part of the package's API.\n\n### 2. Why does it still work as `closest()`?\n\nIf your package `Imports` or uses `dplyr` via the NAMESPACE (either with `library(dplyr)` or `importFrom(dplyr, ...)` or similar), and you call `closest()`, it works **because it's present in the dplyr namespace via `import()` statements, but not exported.** \n\nBut:\n\n- **This is fragile and discouraged:** Unexported (\"internal\") functions may change or disappear without notice.\n- **Causes lint/build errors:** R CMD check or lintr notices you’re using a non-exported function.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix**\n\n### 💡 **Best Practice: DON'T use unexported functions**\n\n**1.

Why does `dplyr::closest()` error?\n\nThe error:\n\n```\ndplyr::closest()\nError: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'\n```\n\nmeans **`closest()` is an internal (unexported) function** in the `dplyr` package. Exported functions are those you can use with `package::function()` syntax; unexported ones are internal helpers and not officially part of the package's API.\n\n### 2. Why does it still work as `closest()`?\n\nIf your package `Imports` or uses `dplyr` via the NAMESPACE (either with `library(dplyr)` or `importFrom(dplyr, ...)` or similar), and you call `closest()`, it works **because it's present in the dplyr namespace via `import()` statements, but not exported.** \n\nBut:\n\n- **This is fragile and discouraged:** Unexported (\"internal\") functions may change or disappear without notice.\n- **Causes lint/build errors:** R CMD check or lintr notices you’re using a non-exported function.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix**\n\n### 💡 **Best Practice: DON'T use unexported functions**\n\n**1. Avoid using `dplyr::closest()` (or just `closest()`) in your package.**\n\n- It's not part of the public API—dplyr authors can change or remove it any time.\n- CRAN guidelines frown upon using internals unless absolutely necessary.\n\n🟩 **Recommended approaches:**\n\n#### **A. Copy the code of `closest()` into your package**\n\n- Find the code for `closest()` in the dplyr source<sup>[1]<\/sup>.\n- Place a copy (with attribution in comments) in your own package code, perhaps renaming or documenting its origin.\n\n#### **B. Find a public, exported equivalent**\n\n- Check if there’s an exported function in dplyr or another tidyverse package that does what you need.\n- Sometimes, `dplyr` makes \"helper\" functions available in new versions: check the documentation for newer SaaS versions.\n\n#### **C. As a last resort (not recommended): Access the function via `:::`, i.e. `dplyr:::closest()`.**\n\n- **Not recommended** for CRAN packages (and you'll get CRAN checks/notes)!\n- For quick prototyping or internal tools **not for CRAN**, you **could** use `dplyr:::closest()`. For CRAN, this will NOT pass checks without justification.\n\n---\n\n### **For NAMESPACE/Lint/build issues**\n\n- Remove all references to `closest()` unless you've defined it yourself.\n- If you've copied the function into your package, use your local version.\n- If referencing an internal function was only a convenience, rewrite your code to avoid it.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Option                 | Safe for CRAN? | How to use                   |\n|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Use `dplyr::closest()` | No             | Not possible (not exported)  |\n| Use `closest()`        | No             | Not portable; not allowed    |\n| Use `dplyr:::closest()`| No             | Only for non-CRAN use        |\n| Copy code to package   | Yes            | Copy code with attribution   |\n| Find public alternative| Yes            | Use exported function        |\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n\n1.

This is because `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will handle it correctly through non-standard evaluation.\n\nThe submitted answer does not mention this solution at all. Instead, it goes into extensive detail about:\n1. Confirming that `closest()` is not exported by dplyr\n2. Explaining why it might work in some contexts but cause linting issues\n3. Suggesting alternative approaches like:\n   - Finding where `closest` comes from\n   - Writing a custom replacement function\n   - Avoiding internal functions in packages\n\nWhile these explanations are thorough and contain generally good R package development advice, they completely miss the simple solution identified in the criterion. The answer never mentions `utils::globalVariables()` as a way to tell R CMD CHECK that \"closest\" is intentionally used as a bare name and should not trigger warnings.\n\nThe answer is technically incorrect because it doesn't provide the specific solution that would address the user's issue while maintaining their current code functionality.\n\nGRADE: I",

Here's what's going on:\n\n## 1. `closest()` is not exported by `dplyr`\n\nYou are correct:  \n```r\ndplyr::closest()\n# Error: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'\n```\nThat’s because `closest` is **not part of dplyr’s public, exported API**. It’s likely an internal helper (or, perhaps, a re-export from another package in your dev environment).\n\n## 2. Why does `closest()` still “work” in your package?\n\nIf you’ve used `library(dplyr)` **inside your package code (which you should not do in R packages!)** or attached dplyr in your R session, R will find `closest()` on the search path. This is misleading, because it won't always be true for users of your package.\n\n## 3. Causes of lint/build issues\n\n- **Linting/build tools** want you to always namespace non-base functions you use, so it is clear where they come from.\n- Since you can’t write `dplyr::closest()`, and you shouldn’t write `library(dplyr)` in your package, R CMD CHECK may warn about missing imports, undefined globals, etc.\n\n---\n\n# How do you solve this?\n\n## **A. Understand where `closest` really comes from**\n\n- Run `getAnywhere(closest)` in your R session **after loading dplyr**. This will show where it is defined.\n    - If it’s not part of dplyr, you’ll need to import it from wherever it actually lives.\n    - If it’s internal to dplyr (not exported), you cannot reliably use it in a CRAN package!\n\n## **B. Replace It with a Stable Alternative**\n\n- If `closest()` is internal, you should **not use it in your package**.\n- There’s probably an equivalent exported function. Example: If you want the closest value in a vector, you can write your own:\n    ```r\n    closest_value <- function(x, target) {\n      x[which.min(abs(x - target))]\n    }\n    ```\n- Or see if another tidyverse or base function does what you want (`purrr::map_dbl()` + `which.min()`, etc).\n\n## **C. If you *really* need internal `dplyr` code (not recommended!):**\n\nYou **could** assign it into your own package’s namespace at build time (by copying its definition), **but this is fragile and strongly discouraged.** Internal functions can change without notice!\n\n---\n\n## **Take-home:**\n- **Never depend on non-exported (`:::`) functions from other packages in your own package.** Use exported, stable interfaces or roll your own helper.\n- If you believe `closest()` should be public, file a feature request at [dplyr’s GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Option                   | Use? | How                                                        | Risks           |\n|--------------------------|------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| `dplyr::closest()`       | ❌   | Not exported, will error                                   | Not allowed     |\n| `dplyr:::closest()`      | ❌   | Access with triple colon IF it exists (not for package use)| Fragile, breaks |\n| Write your own function  | ✅   | See above                                                  | Stable          |\n| Find exported alternative| ✅   | Use a similar exported function                            | Stable          |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nRefactor your code to stop using `closest()` from dplyr—define your own helper or use something exported.\n\n---\n\n#### Feel free to paste what you want `closest()` to do and I'll suggest a one-liner!"
