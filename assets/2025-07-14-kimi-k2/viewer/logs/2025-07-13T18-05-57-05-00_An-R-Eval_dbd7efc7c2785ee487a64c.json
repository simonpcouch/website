To make the **height** of each bar represent the **proportion** of diamonds with a given `cut` (instead of the count), and to still have bars filled by `clarity`, you can use the `position = \"fill\"` argument in `geom_bar()`. This rescales the heights within each `cut` to sum to 1 (proportion).\n\nHere’s your modified code:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `position = \"fill\"` makes the heights of all bars equal (total = 1) and **fills** each bar according to the **proportion** of each `clarity` category **within each `cut`**.\n- Now, each bar shows the composition of `clarity` within each `cut`, and the bar heights are proportionate, not absolute counts.\n\nLet me know if you need the y-axis to actually show the word \"proportion\" or other customizations!",

At least one instance of \"Type_II\" **AND**\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submitted code, there's a significant issue with the logic. The code correctly identifies:\n- If an ID has any Type_II records\n- If an ID has two Type_I records at least 90 days apart\n\nHowever, the logic implementation is wrong. The criteria states that both conditions must be met (need Type_II AND two Type_I records within 90 days), but the code is checking:\n```r\nFlag = as.integer(has_type_ii & has_two_type_i_90_days_apart)\n```\n\nThis is correct - both conditions must be met.\n\nThe criterion answer suggests using `|` (OR) rather than `&` (AND):\n```r\nFlag = as.numeric(any(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90))\n```\n\nThis is incorrect since the task description clearly states both conditions need to be met.\n\nAdditionally, there's a discrepancy in how the \"90 days\" criterion is interpreted. The task asks for Type_I occurrences \"within at least 90 days of one another,\" but the code is checking if dates are \"at least 90 days apart\" (≥90), which is the opposite of what's being asked for (should be ≤90).\n\nThe criterion sample code also uses \"≤ 90\" which is correct for \"within 90 days\" but combined with the OR operator which is incorrect.\n\nSince the submission correctly uses AND logic but has the wrong interpretation of the 90-day window, I'll grade this as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

For each ID, checking if any `Type_II` exists.\n2. For each ID, checking if there are at least two `Type_I` visits **and** at least two of them are at least 90 days apart.\n    - You can do this by ranking/filtering the `type == \"Type_I\"` visits, getting all date differences among them, and checking if any abs diff is ≥90 days.\n\nHere's one efficient tidyverse approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(\n    has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    type_i_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(\n    has_type_ii = first(has_type_ii),\n    type_i_dates = first(type_i_dates),\n    has_two_type_i_90_days_apart = {\n      dts <- sort(unique(type_i_dates[[1]]))\n      n <- length(dts)\n      if (n < 2) FALSE else any(abs(outer(dts, dts, \"-\")) >= 90)\n    }\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii & has_two_type_i_90_days_apart)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `has_type_ii`: TRUE if the ID ever had a `Type_II`\n- `type_i_dates`: list of all `date`s for `Type_I` for this ID\n- In summarise, we extract and sort the unique Type_I dates for the ID\n- We use `outer()` to get all possible differences between pairs of Type_I dates and check if any are at least 90 days apart\n- The final flag is set if **both** criteria are met.\n- Output contains just `ID` and `Flag`.\n\n### Output\n\nFor your sample data, you'll get:\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you need this wrapped in a function, or extra columns!**\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne can also use mutate() to first create\nintermediate variables:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  mutate(\n    flag_i = any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90),\n    flag_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    .by = ID,\n  ) |>\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.numeric(any(flag_i | flag_2)),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer correctly implements the specified criteria for setting the boolean flag:\n\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\" **AND**\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLooking at the submitted code, there's a significant issue with the logic. The code correctly identifies:\n- If an ID has any Type_II records\n- If an ID has two Type_I records at least 90 days apart\n\nHowever, the logic implementation is wrong. The criteria states that both conditions must be met (need Type_II AND two Type_I records within 90 days), but the code is checking:\n```r\nFlag = as.integer(has_type_ii & has_two_type_i_90_days_apart)\n```\n\nThis is correct - both conditions must be met.\n\nThe criterion answer suggests using `|` (OR) rather than `&` (AND):\n```r\nFlag = as.numeric(any(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90))\n```\n\nThis is incorrect since the task description clearly states both conditions need to be met.\n\nAdditionally, there's a discrepancy in how the \"90 days\" criterion is interpreted. The task asks for Type_I occurrences \"within at least 90 days of one another,\" but the code is checking if dates are \"at least 90 days apart\" (≥90), which is the opposite of what's being asked for (should be ≤90).\n\nThe criterion sample code also uses \"≤ 90\" which is correct for \"within 90 days\" but combined with the OR operator which is incorrect.\n\nSince the submission correctly uses AND logic but has the wrong interpretation of the 90-day window, I'll grade this as partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

Let's break it down:\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n\nWe need to set `Flag = 1` **if both**:\n1. There is at least one \"Type_II\" event (`any(type == \"Type_II\")`)\n2. There are at least **two** \"Type_I\" visits within **at least** 90 days of each other (i.e., separated by 90 days or more)\n\nNotice: The second condition means at least **2 Type_I rows** whose dates differ by at least 90 days. You wrote: \"occur within at least 90 days of one another\", which is ambiguous—please clarify. I’ll assume you mean \"at least 90 days **apart**\".\n\n#### Here's how to do this in R using tidyverse\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # For each ID, get all Type_I dates\n    Type_I_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    has_Type_II = any(type == \"Type_II\")\n  ) %>%\n  summarise(\n    # For the Type_I dates, check if any pair is at least 90 days apart\n    has_two_Type_I_90d = {\n      d <- sort(unique(Type_I_dates[[1]]))\n      if(length(d) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        mat <- abs(outer(d, d, \"-\"))\n        any(mat[upper.tri(mat)] >= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    has_Type_II = first(has_Type_II)\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_Type_II & has_two_Type_I_90d)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\n#### Output\n\nYou'll get a tibble like:\n\n| ID     | Flag |\n|--------|------|\n| 000000 | 0    |\n| 000001 | 1    |\n| 000002 | 1    |\n| 000003 | 1    |\n| 000004 | 1    |\n| 000005 | 1    |\n| 000006 | 0    |\n\n---\n\n#### **Explanation**\n- For each `ID`:\n  - Find if there is any `\"Type_II\"`\n  - Extract the dates for all `\"Type_I\"` entries\n  - Check if there are at least two dates that are **at least 90 days apart**\n    - If so, and if there is also `\"Type_II\"`, set `Flag = 1`\n    - Otherwise, `Flag = 0`\n\n---\n\n**If you need clarification on the date logic (\"within at least 90 days of one another\"), let me know!** The code above checks for \"at least 90 days apart\". If you meant \"within 90 days\" (i.e. **at most** 90 days apart), just change `>=` to `<=` in the line with `any(mat[upper.tri(mat)] >= 90)`.\n\nLet me know if you want any tweaks!\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne can also use mutate() to first create\nintermediate variables:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  mutate(\n    flag_i = any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90),\n    flag_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    .by = ID,\n  ) |>\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.numeric(any(flag_i | flag_2)),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted solution correctly implements the logic described in the task criterion.\n\nThe criterion describes two approaches:\n1. Using `group_by()` and `summarize()` with a check for either Type_II OR two Type_I dates within 90 days\n2. Using `mutate()` to create intermediate flags and then summarizing\n\nThe submitted solution has some issues:\n\n1. **Logic Error**: The submission checks for two Type_I dates that are AT LEAST 90 days apart, but the criterion specifies checking if dates are WITHIN 90 days (i.e., ≤ 90 days).\n\n2. **Logical Combination Error**: The submission uses `&` (AND) between the Type_II check and the Type_I date check, while the criterion solutions use `|` (OR).\n\n3. **Implementation Approach**: The submission uses a complex method with matrices and list objects, which is valid but more complex than needed.\n\n4. **Variable Naming**: The submission creates variable names that don't match the criterion's examples.\n\nWhile the code would execute, it would produce incorrect results because:\n- It uses the wrong logical operator (AND instead of OR)\n- It checks for dates separated by AT LEAST 90 days instead of WITHIN 90 days\n\nThese are fundamental logical errors that would produce incorrect results.\n\nGRADE: I",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted solution meets the criterion for correctly implementing the boolean flag based on the required conditions.\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n1. It correctly identifies that we need to check for two conditions: existence of \"Type_II\" and proximity of \"Type_I\" records.\n\n2. However, there's a significant logical error. The criterion specifies that the flag should be 1 if EITHER condition is true:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\" OR\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submitted solution uses `&` (AND) instead of `|` (OR) in the final condition:\n```r\nFlag = as.integer(has_type_ii & type_i_pairs_90)\n```\n\nAdditionally, there's a bug in the logic for determining if Type_I records are within 90 days. The problem specifies \"within at least 90 days\" which means they need to be 90 days or less apart, but the code checks for records that are at least 90 days apart (using `>= 90`).\n\nThe criterion solution correctly uses:\n```r\nany(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n```\n\nThese errors would lead to incorrect results, especially with the misunderstanding of what \"within 90 days\" means.\n\nGRADE: I",

Here's a step-by-step tidyverse solution:\n\n**Step 1:** For each `ID`, set two flags:\n\n- **Flag 1:** Has at least one `\"Type_II\"` record?\n- **Flag 2:** Has at least two `\"Type_I\"` records separated by at least 90 days?\n\n**Step 2:** Combine those two flags into the final output.\n\nLet's do this in code!\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    # Flag if there is at least one \"Type_II\"\n    has_type_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # Get all Type_I dates\n    type_i_dates = list(date[type == \"Type_I\"]),\n    # Count how many pairs of Type_I visits are at least 90 days apart\n    type_i_pairs_90 = {\n      # Get dates, sort\n      dates <- sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])\n      # If less than 2 Type_I, always FALSE\n      if(length(dates) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        # Compute all pairs and differences\n        any(outer(dates, dates, function(x, y) abs(as.numeric(x-y))) >= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(has_type_ii & type_i_pairs_90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     Flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation:**\n- **`has_type_ii`** is TRUE if at least one `\"Type_II\"` for the ID.\n- **`type_i_pairs_90`** checks if there's any pair of `\"Type_I\"` visits at least 90 days apart (uses `outer()` to check all pairs).\n- The final **`Flag`** is `1` if BOTH criteria are TRUE.\n\nLet me know if you'd like this further explained or tailored!\n***\n[Criterion]: One solution is to `group_by()` and summarize:\n\n```\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarize(\n    Flag = as.numeric(\n      any(type == \"Type_II\") |\n      any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nOne can also use mutate() to first create\nintermediate variables:\n\n```\ndf |> \n  mutate(\n    flag_i = any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90),\n    flag_ii = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    .by = ID,\n  ) |>\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.numeric(any(flag_i | flag_2)),\n    .by = ID\n  )\n```\n\nNo need to use the exact same syntax, and either pipe is fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submitted solution meets the criterion for correctly implementing the boolean flag based on the required conditions.\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n1. It correctly identifies that we need to check for two conditions: existence of \"Type_II\" and proximity of \"Type_I\" records.\n\n2. However, there's a significant logical error. The criterion specifies that the flag should be 1 if EITHER condition is true:\n   - At least one instance of \"Type_II\" OR\n   - Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submitted solution uses `&` (AND) instead of `|` (OR) in the final condition:\n```r\nFlag = as.integer(has_type_ii & type_i_pairs_90)\n```\n\nAdditionally, there's a bug in the logic for determining if Type_I records are within 90 days. The problem specifies \"within at least 90 days\" which means they need to be 90 days or less apart, but the code checks for records that are at least 90 days apart (using `>= 90`).\n\nThe criterion solution correctly uses:\n```r\nany(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n```\n\nThese errors would lead to incorrect results, especially with the misunderstanding of what \"within 90 days\" means.\n\nGRADE: I",

The main problem is that the submission groups by both `origin` AND `tailnum` when creating the lagged variable. The criterion specifies that we should only be concerned with flights from the same airport (origin), regardless of which plane (tailnum) is involved. The correct approach is to group only by `origin` as shown in the example code.\n2. The submission arranges by `origin, tailnum, year, month, day, dep_time` rather than just `origin, month, day, dep_time`. While including year and tailnum might not cause errors, it doesn't follow the intended approach of looking at consecutive flights from the same airport.\n\nThe binning of previous delay values into 10-minute intervals is acceptable according to the criterion, which states that \"it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\"\n\nWhile the code would produce a visualization showing some relationship between delays, it wouldn't correctly address the temporal correlation between consecutive flights at the same airport, which is the core of the question.\n\nGRADE: P",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

Here's how you can **visualize the relationship between a flight's departure delay and that of the immediately preceding flight** using the `tidyverse` (specifically dplyr and ggplot2), with `lag()`.\n\nWe need to:\n\n- For each plane (tailnum), at each origin, sort flights in time order.\n- Use `lag()` to get the previous flight's dep_delay.\n- Plot mean `dep_delay` (y-axis) vs **previous flight's dep_delay** (x-axis).\n\nHere's a minimal, canonical way to do it in R:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, tailnum, year, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  group_by(origin, tailnum) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Remove missing values (where prev flight doesn't exist or dep_delay is NA)\nflights_lagged_clean <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))\n\n# Bin/round the previous delay to help aggregation and plotting\nflights_lagged_binned <- flights_lagged_clean %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_bin = round(prev_dep_delay, -1)) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE), n = n())\n\n# Make the plot\nggplot(flights_lagged_binned, aes(x = prev_dep_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay (binned to 10 min)\",\n    y = \"Mean Departure Delay of Next Flight\",\n    title = \"Mean dep_delay vs. Previous Flight's dep_delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Binning `prev_dep_delay` helps see patterns and reduce noise.\n- You could facet by carrier/origin/tailnum for deeper insight.\n- The plot and correlation may be strong, weak, or nonlinear depending on workflow and airport congestion.\n\n---\n\n**If you want a direct scatter plot (less smooth, more noisy):**\n\n```r\nggplot(flights_lagged_clean, aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_hex(bins = 50) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight's Departure Delay\",\n    y = \"Departure Delay of Next Flight\",\n    title = \"dep_delay vs Previous Flight's dep_delay\"\n  )\n```\nA hexbin plot helps with overplotting.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’d like explanation or a version faceted by airport or airline!\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same\nairport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of\nJFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I'll evaluate the submitted answer against the criterion for visualizing temporal correlation in flight delays.\n\nThe submission has several strengths:\n- It correctly uses `lag()` to get the previous flight's departure delay\n- It properly handles missing values\n- It creates an appropriate visualization showing the relationship between previous delay and current delay\n- It includes a smoothed trend line to help visualize patterns\n\nHowever, there are issues when compared to the criterion:\n1. The main problem is that the submission groups by both `origin` AND `tailnum` when creating the lagged variable. The criterion specifies that we should only be concerned with flights from the same airport (origin), regardless of which plane (tailnum) is involved. The correct approach is to group only by `origin` as shown in the example code.\n2. The submission arranges by `origin, tailnum, year, month, day, dep_time` rather than just `origin, month, day, dep_time`. While including year and tailnum might not cause errors, it doesn't follow the intended approach of looking at consecutive flights from the same airport.\n\nThe binning of previous delay values into 10-minute intervals is acceptable according to the criterion, which states that \"it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\"\n\nWhile the code would produce a visualization showing some relationship between delays, it wouldn't correctly address the temporal correlation between consecutive flights at the same airport, which is the core of the question.\n\nGRADE: P",

              "text": "Certainly! To **visualize the mean departure delay of a flight against the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight**, you can use the tidyverse tools in R, including `dplyr::lag()` to get the previous flight’s departure delay and `ggplot2` for visualization.\n\nHere’s how to do it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Ensure flights are in the correct order**\n\nYou want to make sure flights are arranged **chronologically** for each _airline_ or optionally for each _tailnum_ (aircraft). For demonstration, let's use all flights as a single sequence, but this can be done by groups if desired.\n\n### **2.

Does the submission group by origin airport?\n2. Does it calculate mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay?\n3. Does it handle NA values properly?\n\nAnalysis:\n- The submission does NOT properly group by origin when creating the lag variable. The code shown arranges by `year, month, day, dep_time` but doesn't group by `origin` when applying `lag()`. This is a critical mistake since the criterion specifically states that delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at another airport.\n\n- The code mentions that grouping could be done (\"add `group_by(day)` or `group_by(carrier)` as appropriate\") but doesn't explicitly include `group_by(origin)` in the main solution.\n\n- The submission does handle NAs by filtering them out with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))`.\n\n- It does provide visualization options, including calculating the mean departure delay binned by previous delay values, which meets that part of the criterion.\n\nHowever, the fundamental error of not grouping by origin when calculating lagged values means the analysis doesn't correctly address the temporal correlation of delays within the same airport, which is the core of the task.\n\nGRADE: P",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code\nto visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs\nthe departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Certainly! To **visualize the mean departure delay of a flight against the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight**, you can use the tidyverse tools in R, including `dplyr::lag()` to get the previous flight’s departure delay and `ggplot2` for visualization.\n\nHere’s how to do it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Ensure flights are in the correct order**\n\nYou want to make sure flights are arranged **chronologically** for each _airline_ or optionally for each _tailnum_ (aircraft). For demonstration, let's use all flights as a single sequence, but this can be done by groups if desired.\n\n### **2. Use `lag()` to get the previous flight’s departure delay**\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%      # arrange by date and time\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))      # add column for previous flight's dep_delay\n```\n\nIf you want to compute this within each day or carrier (to avoid artifacts across days or carriers), add `group_by(day)` or `group_by(carrier)` as appropriate.\n\n### **3. Remove NAs**\n\nThe first row (or first row in each group) will have an `NA` for `prev_dep_delay`, so remove those:\n\n```r\nflights_clean <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))\n```\n\n### **4. Summarize or visualize directly**\n\nIf you want the **mean** dep_delay for each value (or bucket) of previous dep_delay, you can use a smoothing plot or bin-and-average:\n\n```r\n# Scatterplot with smooth trend line\nggplot(flights_clean, aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +                    # plot raw data, lower alpha for visibility\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +  # add trend\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Temporal Correlation of Departure Delays\"\n  )\n```\n\nOr, approximately:\n\n```r\n# Optional: bin the previous delay for a clearer plot\nflights_binned <- flights_clean %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-30, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(flights_binned, aes(x = prev_dep_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight Departure Delay (binned, min)\",\n    y = \"Average Departure Delay\",\n    title = \"Average Departure Delay vs. Previous Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- Use `arrange()` to ensure chronological order.\n- Use `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` to get the previous delay.\n- Use `ggplot2` to plot `dep_delay` vs. `prev_dep_delay`, optionally with smoothing.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like the code grouped by carrier or by tailnum (plane), or only for the same airport!**\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same\nairport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of\nJFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I'll evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for visualizing mean departure delay vs. the immediately preceding flight's delay.\n\nKey issues to check:\n1. Does the submission group by origin airport?\n2. Does it calculate mean departure delay grouped by the lagged departure delay?\n3. Does it handle NA values properly?\n\nAnalysis:\n- The submission does NOT properly group by origin when creating the lag variable. The code shown arranges by `year, month, day, dep_time` but doesn't group by `origin` when applying `lag()`. This is a critical mistake since the criterion specifically states that delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at another airport.\n\n- The code mentions that grouping could be done (\"add `group_by(day)` or `group_by(carrier)` as appropriate\") but doesn't explicitly include `group_by(origin)` in the main solution.\n\n- The submission does handle NAs by filtering them out with `filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))`.\n\n- It does provide visualization options, including calculating the mean departure delay binned by previous delay values, which meets that part of the criterion.\n\nHowever, the fundamental error of not grouping by origin when calculating lagged values means the analysis doesn't correctly address the temporal correlation of delays within the same airport, which is the core of the task.\n\nGRADE: P",

To **visualize the mean departure delay of a flight against the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight**, you can use the tidyverse tools in R, including `dplyr::lag()` to get the previous flight’s departure delay and `ggplot2` for visualization.\n\nHere’s how to do it step by step:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Ensure flights are in the correct order**\n\nYou want to make sure flights are arranged **chronologically** for each _airline_ or optionally for each _tailnum_ (aircraft). For demonstration, let's use all flights as a single sequence, but this can be done by groups if desired.\n\n### **2. Use `lag()` to get the previous flight’s departure delay**\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time) %>%      # arrange by date and time\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))      # add column for previous flight's dep_delay\n```\n\nIf you want to compute this within each day or carrier (to avoid artifacts across days or carriers), add `group_by(day)` or `group_by(carrier)` as appropriate.\n\n### **3. Remove NAs**\n\nThe first row (or first row in each group) will have an `NA` for `prev_dep_delay`, so remove those:\n\n```r\nflights_clean <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(prev_dep_delay))\n```\n\n### **4. Summarize or visualize directly**\n\nIf you want the **mean** dep_delay for each value (or bucket) of previous dep_delay, you can use a smoothing plot or bin-and-average:\n\n```r\n# Scatterplot with smooth trend line\nggplot(flights_clean, aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +                    # plot raw data, lower alpha for visibility\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +  # add trend\n  labs(\n    x = \"Departure Delay of Previous Flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Departure Delay of Current Flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"Temporal Correlation of Departure Delays\"\n  )\n```\n\nOr, approximately:\n\n```r\n# Optional: bin the previous delay for a clearer plot\nflights_binned <- flights_clean %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-30, 300, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(flights_binned, aes(x = prev_dep_delay_bin, y = mean_dep_delay, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous Flight Departure Delay (binned, min)\",\n    y = \"Average Departure Delay\",\n    title = \"Average Departure Delay vs. Previous Delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- Use `arrange()` to ensure chronological order.\n- Use `mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))` to get the previous delay.\n- Use `ggplot2` to plot `dep_delay` vs. `prev_dep_delay`, optionally with smoothing.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you'd like the code grouped by carrier or by tailnum (plane), or only for the same airport!**"

Here’s how you could do it:\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Sort** the data in the original departure order (for each day and origin, since delays will be most autocorrelated within origin airports).\n2. **Calculate lag**: For each flight, get the `dep_delay` of the immediately previous flight (at the same origin, on the same day).\n3. **Visualize**: Plot current `dep_delay` vs previous (`lagged`) `dep_delay`.\n\n### R code\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Calculate dep_delay lagged by previous flight\ndelay_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, year, month, day, dep_time) %>%  # Sort by time at each origin each day\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Visualization:\nggplot(delay_lagged, aes(x = dep_delay_lag, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +          # use transparency for overplotting\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +       # Show linear trend\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's dep_delay (min)\",\n    y = \"Current dep_delay (min)\",\n    title = \"Departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- If you want the _mean_ `dep_delay` for each prior delay value, you can bin `dep_delay_lag` and plot the mean.\n- You might also facet by `origin` if you want to see differences by airport.\n\n### Mean dep_delay for binned previous delays\n\n```r\ndelay_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay_lag)) %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(dep_delay_lag, breaks = seq(-50, 300, by=10))) %>%\n  group_by(bin) %>%\n  summarize(mean_current = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            mean_lagged = mean(dep_delay_lag, na.rm=TRUE), n=n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = mean_lagged, y = mean_current)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Binned previous dep_delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean current dep_delay (min)\",\n      title = \"Mean dep_delay vs. previous flight's dep_delay\"\n    )\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `arrange()` then `group_by()` and `mutate(lag(...))` to get previous flight's delay.\n- Plot lagged vs current delay to visualize correlation.\n- Optionally, bin and plot mean values for clarity."

Here’s how you could do it:\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Sort** the data in the original departure order (for each day and origin, since delays will be most autocorrelated within origin airports).\n2. **Calculate lag**: For each flight, get the `dep_delay` of the immediately previous flight (at the same origin, on the same day).\n3. **Visualize**: Plot current `dep_delay` vs previous (`lagged`) `dep_delay`.\n\n### R code\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Calculate dep_delay lagged by previous flight\ndelay_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, year, month, day, dep_time) %>%  # Sort by time at each origin each day\n  group_by(origin, year, month, day) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Visualization:\nggplot(delay_lagged, aes(x = dep_delay_lag, y = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +          # use transparency for overplotting\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +       # Show linear trend\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous flight's dep_delay (min)\",\n    y = \"Current dep_delay (min)\",\n    title = \"Departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay\"\n  )\n```\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- If you want the _mean_ `dep_delay` for each prior delay value, you can bin `dep_delay_lag` and plot the mean.\n- You might also facet by `origin` if you want to see differences by airport.\n\n### Mean dep_delay for binned previous delays\n\n```r\ndelay_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay_lag)) %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(dep_delay_lag, breaks = seq(-50, 300, by=10))) %>%\n  group_by(bin) %>%\n  summarize(mean_current = mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE),\n            mean_lagged = mean(dep_delay_lag, na.rm=TRUE), n=n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = mean_lagged, y = mean_current)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Binned previous dep_delay (min)\",\n      y = \"Mean current dep_delay (min)\",\n      title = \"Mean dep_delay vs. previous flight's dep_delay\"\n    )\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Use `arrange()` then `group_by()` and `mutate(lag(...))` to get previous flight's delay.\n- Plot lagged vs current delay to visualize correlation.\n- Optionally, bin and plot mean values for clarity.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same\nairport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of\nJFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submitted answer meets the criterion of correctly visualizing the mean departure delay vs. the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight from the same airport.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Arranges the data by origin, year, month, day, and dep_time\n2. Groups by origin (and date components) when calculating the lagged delay\n3. Creates a visualization showing the relationship between current and previous flight delays\n\nIn the first code sample, the submission calculates the lag correctly but doesn't aggregate to get mean departure delays for each lagged delay value. Instead, it plots individual points with a smoothed line.\n\nHowever, in the second code sample, the submission does correctly:\n- Filter out NA values\n- Bin the lagged departure delays\n- Calculate mean current departure delay for each bin\n- Plot these means against the lagged delays\n\nThe approach in the second code sample aligns with the criterion's expectation to visualize the mean departure delay against previous flight delays from the same airport. The binning approach is acceptable as mentioned in the criterion.\n\nWhile the initial visualization wasn't exactly what was asked for, the second visualization correctly implements the requested analysis, and the explanation shows understanding of the core concepts.\n\nGRADE: C",

The error `HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed` means **you're using the wrong HTTP method** for what the endpoint expects.\n\n## Looking at your curl command\n\n```sh\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n- `-X 'GET'` says use GET method.\n- `-d ...` sends data, which **is not allowed with GET** by many APIs; instead, use POST or PUT with a body.\n\n## The fix\n\n1. If the endpoint **expects POST**:\n   - Change your curl and R request to use **POST** instead of GET.\n\n**CURL FIX:**\n```sh\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n\n**HTTR2 FIX:**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  ) %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\")   # <-- ADD THIS LINE\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\nOr, simply set the method in the request call:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\", method = \"POST\") %>%\n  ... # rest of your code\n```\n\n## Alternative: If it MUST be GET\nIf the API expects GET, **then do not send a request body**; put your parameters in the query string, like:\n```sh\ncurl -G \\\n  'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\nand in R:\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    `accept` = \"application/json\",\n    `ApiKey` = \"xxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n## **Summary**\n- HTTP 405 usually means \"wrong method\".\n- **POST**: If you send a body, use `POST`.\n- **GET**: Use query parameters, no request body.\n\n**Check the API documentation** to confirm what is expected!  \nIf unsure, try with `POST` as shown above—it is the usual for JSON bodies.",

This typically means **you are using the wrong HTTP verb** for this endpoint.\n\n# What's wrong?\n\nYour **CURL** command (and R code) uses **GET** and passes a request body (`-d` in cURL, or `req_body_json()` in `httr2`).  \n**However**:  \n- The HTTP standard forbids a body in GET requests. Most APIs will **reject GET requests with a body**.\n- If you are trying to send a body (with parameters like `id`, `fechaInicial`, `fechaFinal`), this almost always means the API expects a `POST` or possibly `PUT` request.\n\n# How to fix\n\n## 1. Change to `POST`, remove body from GET\n\n**CURL:**\n```sh\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n  \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n}'\n```\n(note: only change `-X 'GET'` to `-X 'POST'`)\n\n**R (`httr2`):**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(\n    list(id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\")\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\n(note: no changes needed, as `req_body_json` automatically uses POST request!)\n\nAlso notice you should use the same variable, `one2`, not `cone2` or so.\n\n## 2. If *only* GET is supported\n\nIf the API **only supports GET** (and doesn't allow request bodies), you cannot send a body. Instead, send values as **query parameters** in the URL:\n\n**CURL**:\n```sh\ncurl -G 'xxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  --data-urlencode \"id=5\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"fechaInicial=2023-02-01\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"fechaFinal=2023-05-01\"\n```\nOr manually:\n```\ncurl 'xxxxxx?id=5&fechaInicial=2023-02-01&fechaFinal=2023-05-01' ...\n```\n\n**R (`httr2`):**\n```r\none2 <- httr2::request(\"xxxxxx\") %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id = 4, fechaInicial = \"2023-07-01\", fechaFinal = \"2023-09-01\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey = \"xxxxx\"\n  )\n\none2 %>% req_perform()\n```\nAnd **remove** the `req_body_json()` part.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Checklist**\n- If the API is designed for a POST request, change GET to POST and keep the JSON body.\n- If the API is designed for GET, **do NOT send a body**; use query parameters.\n\n**Check your API documentation** to confirm which method and parameter passing is supported for this endpoint.\n\n---\n\n**Extra note:** The HTTP 405 message often comes with an `Allow` header telling you which verbs are supported. You can inspect it if you want more confirmation.\n\nIf you still have trouble, please share the API documentation or endpoint details."

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: This is an excellent question—**you want all legend entries (including those for unused factor levels) to show the expected colored points, not just a blank space.**\n\nBy default, **ggplot2** will show the legend entry **with the correct color**, but it draws a \"legend key\" with a blank/no-point for levels not present in the data, because `geom_point` never sees that level.\n\n## Solution\n\nYou can **add \"dummy\" data** for the missing factor levels, using `NA` for coordinates (so they don't appear in the plot, but trigger the legend to show the key as a point).\n\nLet's extend your `df` by a row per unused level, and use `NA` for x and y:\n\n```r\ndf_full <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\")\n)\n```\n\nNow, plot as before:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(df_full, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n- By adding a row with `z = \"d\"` and `NA` for the coordinates, you **don't add any extra points** to the plot itself (as points at `NA` are not drawn).\n- However, `geom_point` now \"sees\" all factor levels, so the legend key for `\"d\"` will **show a colored point**, not a blank.\n\n## Alternative: Using `complete` (if you have many levels)\n\nIf you have many levels, consider using `tidyr::complete`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndf_complete <- tidyr::complete(df, z = levels(df$z), fill = list(x = NA, y = NA))\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAdd rows with `NA` coordinates for unused levels. This ensures they appear in the legend with a point, colored as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Full example for copy-paste:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add a row for the unused level\ndf_full <- rbind(df, data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = \"d\"))\n\nggplot(df_full, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will show all four legend items as colored points!\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

This **blank legend key** for unused factor levels is a classic pain point in `ggplot2`, and the issue [is documented on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/1781).\n\n**What's happening:**  \nBy default, `ggplot2` only draws legend keys/shapes for values actually present in the data. So, if \"d\" isn't present, it won't draw the *shape* (here, a dot), even if you set `drop = FALSE` in your scale.\n\n**Desired behavior:**  \nYou want the legend to show a colored dot for \"d\", *even if no data point is mapped to it*.\n\n---\n\n## Solution/workaround\n\nYou must **add a dummy/phantom row** to your data so that \"d\" is included in the mapping. You can set its coordinates to `NA`, so it won't plot on the graph, but the legend will include a dot for \"d\" in the right color.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add a dummy row for the unused level\ndf2 <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**Result:**  \nNow, the legend will show a **green dot** next to \"d\", just like the other levels, even though there is no \"d\" point in the plot.\n\n---\n\n#### Why does this work?\n- Adding a row with `x = NA`, `y = NA`, `z = \"d\"` means ggplot2 includes \"d\" in the legend shape/color, but doesn't plot anything because coordinates are `NA`.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Using `guides()`\n\nIf you want to control other aspects, you can use the `guides()` function, but it doesn't fix this issue directly—the dummy-row is the robust solution.\n\n---\n\n#### In summary:  \n- **Yes, you need to add a dummy data row for unused levels to get a proper colored key-dot in the legend.**  \n- Use `drop = FALSE` for the scale, and add an `NA` point for each unused level.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see a version for **multiple unused levels** or a more automated way!"

You can set its coordinates to `NA`, so it won't plot on the graph, but the legend will include a dot for \"d\" in the right color.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Add a dummy row for the unused level\ndf2 <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n**Result:**  \nNow, the legend will show a **green dot** next to \"d\", just like the other levels, even though there is no \"d\" point in the plot.\n\n---\n\n#### Why does this work?\n- Adding a row with `x = NA`, `y = NA`, `z = \"d\"` means ggplot2 includes \"d\" in the legend shape/color, but doesn't plot anything because coordinates are `NA`.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Using `guides()`\n\nIf you want to control other aspects, you can use the `guides()` function, but it doesn't fix this issue directly—the dummy-row is the robust solution.\n\n---\n\n#### In summary:  \n- **Yes, you need to add a dummy data row for unused levels to get a proper colored key-dot in the legend.**  \n- Use `drop = FALSE` for the scale, and add an `NA` point for each unused level.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see a version for **multiple unused levels** or a more automated way!"

How can I do that?\n***\n[Submission]: Great question! The behavior you're seeing—**an empty dot for the unused level (\"d\") in the legend**—is actually *standard* for `ggplot2`, and it happens because there are no data points associated with this level, so the legend shows the color but doesn't draw a symbol.\n\n**But:** it *is* possible to force the unused level to show a symbol in the legend by providing an (invisible) \"dummy\" data point for the unused factor level. This trick works by adding an extra row to your data with a new group, and then ensuring that it does **not** appear on the plot (e.g., by setting it to `NA` on the y axis so it can't be drawn).\n\nHere's a practical way to do it:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create a dummy row for the unused level\n```r\n# Original data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\n# Add a dummy row for 'd'\ndummy <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n\n# Combine\ndf2 <- rbind(df, dummy)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Make the plot\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(data = df2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\n---\n\n**What does this do?**\n- By having a `NA` value in `x` or `y`, the extra point is ignored in the plot, but *does* get recognized for the legend, so a dot of the correct color appears next to \"d\" in the legend.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Note\n\n- The trick works as long as **the `aes` mapping includes the unused level (by adding the dummy row)** and the actual position is NA to prevent a visible point.\n- You can extend this trick to other geoms and other aesthetic mappings.\n\n---\n\n#### **Result**\n\nThe legend will now show **all four levels** (\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\") with a colored dot next to each, even if \"d\" is unused in the actual data.\n\n---\n\n#### **References**\n\n- [Make ggplot2 show a full legend for both observed and not-observed groups](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26253361/make-ggplot2-show-a-full-legend-for-both-observed-and-not-observed-groups) (Stack Overflow)\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

In R, you can use `utils::URLencode()` or, more robustly (especially for parameters, not full URLs), use `httr2::url_encode()` or `curl::curl_escape()`.\n\nAlso, you **should not** build URLs by pasting/query-string manually; instead, use helper functions or build the query list separately and let the library handle encoding.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Approach with `httr2`**\n\nYou don't need to build the URL with the query encoded yourself. `httr2` allows you to specify parameters using the `req_url_query()` function, which handles encoding for you.\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nresp <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key) %>%\n  req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **If You MUST Build the URL Manually**\n\nYou should encode the `address`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(glue)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\naddress_enc <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\nurl <- glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address_enc}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\n# Check the result\n# url\n# [1] \"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q=Prince%20st.,%20New%20York%2010012&api_key=my_secret_api_key\"\n\nlibrary(httr2)\nresponse <- request(url) %>%\n  req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Prefer `req_url_query()`, which will do the right encoding for you.**\n- If constructing URLs manually, **encode query parameters** with `URLencode()` or similar.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [`httr2` documentation on query parameters](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/requests.html#url-query)\n***\n[Criterion]: You could format `address` to make at a valid URL by replacing spaces, e.g.\n\n```\naddress <- \"Prince+st+New+York+10012\"\n```\n\nOr by using a function to do so:\n\n```\naddress <- URLencode(\"Prince st., New York 10012\")\n```\n\nHowever, the best solution would be to use a function that handles these \nissues for you, e.g. `httr2::req_url_query()`.

If your parameters contain spaces, commas, or other special characters, you need to encode them to make the URL valid.\n\nIn R, this is typically fixed by applying `utils::URLencode()` or, more robustly, by specifying query parameters separately in your request rather than building the full URL yourself.\n\n### Solution 1: Let `httr2::request()` handle the base URL and parameters\n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# Build the base URL, not the full URL\nreq <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key)\n\nresponse <- req %>% req_perform()\n```\n\n- `req_url_query()` properly encodes the query parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Solution 2: Manually URL-encode the address\n\nIf you really want to construct the URL yourself, use `URLencode()`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\naddress_enc <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\n\nurl <- glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address_enc}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform()\n```\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n*Don't insert raw query parameters into a URL string! Always encode/escape them. Using `httr2::req_url_query()` is the easiest and least error-prone method.*\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n- `?httr2::req_url_query`  \n- [Geocode Maps API documentation](https://geocode.maps.co/)",

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies both issues with the original code:\n\n1. It explains that the message is about grouping, specifically that after `summarize()` the data remains grouped by `carrier`\n2. It correctly identifies that this grouping affects the `filter()` operation, causing it to find minimums within each carrier group rather than the overall minimum\n3. It provides two solutions:\n   - Solution 1: Add `.groups = \"drop\"` to `summarize()`\n   - Solution 2: Use `ungroup()` before filtering\n\nThe criterion specifically mentions adding `.groups = \"drop\"` to the `summarize()` function, which is exactly what the first solution in the submission recommends. The submission also explains why this solution works - it removes the grouping so that `filter()` finds the overall minimum instead of minimums per carrier.\n\nThe explanation in the submission is comprehensive and correctly addresses the issue mentioned in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

You can override using the `.groups` argument.\"\n\nThis is because `summarise()` *by default* keeps grouping variables that aren't summarized away.  \nYou grouped by **carrier and month**, but your `summarize()` only summarizes one value, leaving the default result *grouped by* carrier:\n\n- `group_by(carrier, month)` (group: carrier & month)\n- `summarize(...)` (summarizes median by group)\n- Output is grouped by \"carrier\" because only month was collapsed in the summarize step.\n\n**This is just an informative message.** It doesn't affect your result, unless you care about the grouping structure afterwards.\nIf you don't want this, you can add `.groups = \"drop\"` like this:\n```r\nsummarise(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n```\n\n## 2. `min()` and Grouped Data\n\nYour code:\n```r\n... |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\nwill select, **within each group** (here, by `carrier`), the value(s) that have the minimum median arrival delay **within that group**.\n\nBut you want the **single overall minimum** across all combinations of (carrier, month).  \nRight now you're getting the minimum **per carrier**, because the data remains grouped by carrier (see above point).\n\n### 🔥 **The Fix**\n\nYou need to **remove all grouping** before filtering for the absolute minimum:\n\n#### Solution 1: Add `.groups = \"drop\"`\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\nNow `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` applies across all rows.\n\n#### Solution 2: Use `ungroup()`\nAlternatively, if you want to keep the default behavior and remove the grouping before filtering:\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n- The message is just telling you about leftover grouping--not an error.\n- The real issue is that you're filtering for minimum *within each group*, not overall.\n- Remove grouping (with `.groups=\"drop\"` or `ungroup()`) **before** filtering for the absolute minimum.\n\n---\n\n**Try either solution, and you'll get the single row where the median arrival delay is lowest across all carriers and months.**\n\nLet me know if you want a more detailed explanation or example output!\n***\n[Criterion]: The message says that after `summarize()` your data is still grouped by `carrier`, therefore\nthe pipeline is giving you the minimum median arrival delay for each carrier.\nIf you want to find the overall median, you need to ask summarize to not group the data by\n`carrier` by adding `.groups = \"drop\"`.\n\n```\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

Let's break down what's happening and how to fix it.\n\n### What's going on\n\n#### Your code:\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n#### The problem\n- Your code groups by **carrier and month** to get the **median arrival delay** for *every* combination of carrier and month (so, many values).\n- Then, `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` finds rows where `median_arr_delay` is equal to the minimum *across all rows remaining*.\n- BUT: `summarize()` by default leaves the data grouped by the **first grouping column** *not* removed (see `?summarize`). Here, that is `carrier`.  \n- The message:  \n  > \"`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\"\n- This means after summarization, your data frame is **still grouped by `carrier`**. Because `min()` is *groupwise* in `dplyr`, your `filter()` finds the *lowest per-carrier*, not overall.\n\n---\n\n### How to get the **single lowest** median, with all columns (possibly more than one if tied):\n\n#### **Option 1 (recommend):** *Ungroup before filtering*  \nJust `ungroup()` so `min(median_arr_delay)` considers all carriers and months:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- Now you get either one or more rows (if ties) with *globally* lowest median arrival delay.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 2:** Use `.groups = \"drop\"` inside `summarize()`\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- This drops all grouping right at summarize, so `min()` is global.\n\n---\n\n### In summary  \n**The key:**  \n**Ungroup** (with `ungroup()` **or** `.groups = \"drop\"` in `summarize()`) **before** filtering for the minimum.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick explanation of the message**\n> \"`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'.\"\n\n- It’s telling you that after summarizing by `carrier` and `month`, it's still keeping `carrier` as a grouping variable by default. That's usually not what you want when computing a global minimum across groups.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you’d like a demonstration code with sample output!**"

Let's break down what's happening and how to fix it.\n\n### What's going on\n\n#### Your code:\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n#### The problem\n- Your code groups by **carrier and month** to get the **median arrival delay** for *every* combination of carrier and month (so, many values).\n- Then, `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` finds rows where `median_arr_delay` is equal to the minimum *across all rows remaining*.\n- BUT: `summarize()` by default leaves the data grouped by the **first grouping column** *not* removed (see `?summarize`). Here, that is `carrier`.  \n- The message:  \n  > \"`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\"\n- This means after summarization, your data frame is **still grouped by `carrier`**. Because `min()` is *groupwise* in `dplyr`, your `filter()` finds the *lowest per-carrier*, not overall.\n\n---\n\n### How to get the **single lowest** median, with all columns (possibly more than one if tied):\n\n#### **Option 1 (recommend):** *Ungroup before filtering*  \nJust `ungroup()` so `min(median_arr_delay)` considers all carriers and months:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- Now you get either one or more rows (if ties) with *globally* lowest median arrival delay.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 2:** Use `.groups = \"drop\"` inside `summarize()`\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- This drops all grouping right at summarize, so `min()` is global.\n\n---\n\n### In summary  \n**The key:**  \n**Ungroup** (with `ungroup()` **or** `.groups = \"drop\"` in `summarize()`) **before** filtering for the minimum.\n\n---\n\n### **Quick explanation of the message**\n> \"`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'.\"\n\n- It’s telling you that after summarizing by `carrier` and `month`, it's still keeping `carrier` as a grouping variable by default. That's usually not what you want when computing a global minimum across groups.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you’d like a demonstration code with sample output!**",

You can override \nusing the `.groups` argument.\", and not a single lowest median arrival delay.\nHow do I fix this?\n***\n[Submission]: Great question! Let's break down what's happening and **how to fix your code**.\n\n### What your code is doing\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- `group_by(carrier, month)`\n  - Data is grouped by **both carrier and month**.\n- `summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))`\n  - Returns a table where **each row is a carrier-month** pair with its median arrival delay.\n- `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))`\n  - Finds **the minimum median** _within each group_. **But** since `summarise()`'s output remains grouped by `carrier` (as the message tells you), `min(median_arr_delay)` is computed **per carrier**.  \n  - You’re getting **multiple rows (one per carrier) with their lowest monthly median**, *not the overall minimum*.\n\n### The message\n> \"`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\"\n\nWhen you summarize by carrier and month, the result is still grouped by carrier by default. R is just telling you this.\n\n---\n\n## **How to Get The Overall Lowest Median (the fix)**\n\nYou want the single **lowest median arrival delay** (across all carrier-month combinations).\n\nHere’s a step-by-step fix:\n\n1. **Ungroup after summarizing** (`ungroup()`): so `filter(min(...))` works across all data, not per group.\n2. **Or use `arrange()` and `slice_head()` for clarity.**\n\n### Fixed code (method 1: ungroup)\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n### Fixed code (method 2: arrange and slice)\n\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  arrange(median_arr_delay) |>\n  slice(1)\n```\n\n- Both will **return only the carrier-month pair(s) with the absolute lowest median arrival delay**.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- The message about grouping is informational.\n- **Add `ungroup()`** before your `filter()` to make `min()` work globally.\n- Or, **use `arrange()` then `slice(1)`**.\n- This returns the overall lowest median, not the lowest per carrier.\n\n**Let me know if you want to find the lowest *per carrier* or need further explanation!**\n***\n[Criterion]: The message says that after `summarize()` your data is still grouped by `carrier`, therefore\nthe pipeline is giving you the minimum median arrival delay for each carrier.\nIf you want to find the overall median, you need to ask summarize to not group the data by\n`carrier` by adding `.groups = \"drop\"`.\n\n```\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission addresses the specific criterion about using `.groups = \"drop\"` to avoid the grouping issue.\n\nThe criterion states that the solution should use `.groups = \"drop\"` within the `summarize()` function to explicitly drop the grouping by carrier.\n\nLooking at the submission:\n1. It correctly explains the issue - that the data remains grouped by carrier after summarizing, causing `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` to find minimums within each carrier group.\n2. It provides two solution methods:\n   - Method 1: Using `ungroup()` after summarizing\n   - Method 2: Using `arrange()` and `slice(1)`\n\nHowever, the submission does not mention the specific solution identified in the criterion, which is to use `.groups = \"drop\"` as an argument within the `summarize()` function. While the suggested solutions (especially `ungroup()`) would functionally solve the problem, they don't match the specific solution expected in the criterion.\n\nThe submission provides correct alternative solutions but fails to mention the specific method required by the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

The criterion solution filters during grouping with filter(n() > 100).\n\n2) For calculating the proportion of NA arr_delays, the submission uses sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n_flights, while the criterion uses mean(is.na(arr_delay)).

This is a common plotting issue.\n\n**What’s happening:**  \n`ggplot2` treats your data as if it’s a single time series because, for all years, `month` repeats from 1 to 12, so it “connects” all years together as if they're one long sequence if you only set `x = month`.\n\n**How to fix:**  \nTo plot a separate line for each year, you need to:\n- Map `group = year` in your aesthetics.  \n- (Optional, but stylistically nicer) Make `color = factor(year)` so each year is a discrete color.\n\n---\n\n**Working code:**\n\n```r\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(color = \"Year\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) # optional: to make x-axis prettier\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- `group = year` ensures each year's months are connected as separate lines.\n- `color = factor(year)` gives each year a distinct color.\n- `scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)` so all months show up on the x-axis.\n\n---\n\n**Bonus tip:**  \nIf you want month names as labels:\n\n```r\nunemployment$month_name <- month.abb[unemployment$month]\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +\n  labs(color = \"Year\", x = \"Month\")\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n> **Add `group = year` to your `aes()`.**\n\nThis is what makes the separate lines!\n***\n[Criterion]: You need to use the `group` aesthetic to indicate which observations should be connected together.\nSince you want a separate line for each year, you need to set `group = year` in your aesthetic mappings.\n\n```\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, group = year, color = year)) +\n  geom_line()\n```  \n\nIf you want year to be treated as a discrete variable for the legend, you can also transform year to a factor.\n\n```\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, group = year, color = as.factor(year))) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n\nHowever note that a discrete scale for more than eight levels is usually not recommended.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

The submission also correctly suggests making year a factor for better color differentiation (`color = factor(year)`), which aligns with the criterion's suggestion about treating year as a discrete variable.\n\nThe submission goes beyond the minimum requirement by adding helpful elements like proper axis labels and breaks, and even provides a bonus tip for using month names - these are good additions but not central to the criterion being assessed.\n\nThe submission fully meets the criterion of using the `group` aesthetic to create separate lines for each year.\n\nGRADE: C",

                  "text": "Great question!  \nThe reason you're getting a **single, zigzagging line** is that `geom_line()` connects points **in the order they are in the data**. Since your data is by month across multiple years, and unless you **group** by year, `geom_line()` will treat it as one sequence, **not starting a new line each January**.\n\n### **How to Fix**\n\n#### **Option 1: Use `group = year` in `aes()`**\nTell ggplot that each year is a separate group:\n\n```r\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n- `color = factor(year)`: ensures distinct colors per year.\n- `group = year`: ensures one line per year (not one long, squiggly line).\n\n#### **Option 2: Use piping and `group_by()` (not required here)**\nIf you use `group_by(year)`, it only affects summarization, not plotting. **You must use `group = year` in ggplot `aes()`**.\n\n#### **Option 3: Make `year` a factor (optional)**\nThis helps with color scales and legends:\n\n```r\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = as.factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Working Example:**\n\n```r\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(color = \"Year\", x = \"Month\", y = \"Median Unemployment Duration (weeks)\")\n```\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nAdd `group = year` inside your `aes()`. That’s what tells ggplot to start a new line for each year!",

Group by: The code then uses `group_by(cut)` to group the data by cut type, which is necessary for calculating proportions within each cut.\n\n3.

Count: The code uses `count(cut, color)` to count the number of diamonds for each combination of cut and color.\n\n2. Group by: The code then uses `group_by(cut)` to group the data by cut type, which is necessary for calculating proportions within each cut.\n\n3. Mutate: Finally, the code uses `mutate(prop = n / sum(n))` to create a new variable showing the proportion of each color within each cut type.\n\nThe primary solution provided in the submission:\n```r\ndiamonds %>%\n  count(cut, color) %>%\n  group_by(cut) %>%\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n```\n\nmatches exactly with the example solution provided in the criterion:\n```\ndiamonds |>\n  count(cut, color) |>\n  group_by(cut) |>\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n```\n\nThe only difference is the use of the pipe operator (`%>%` vs `|>`), but both are valid in R, with `|>` being the newer native pipe.\n\nThe submission also includes additional variations that show just the proportions or reshape the data, but these are optional extras that don't affect the correctness of the main solution.\n\nGRADE: C"

Let's look at what happens:\n\n- **Case when argument is used with name:**  \n  `task_create(dataset = simple_addition)`  \n  Here, `substitute(dataset)` will yield the variable name (`simple_addition`).\n\n- **However, by placing `deparse(substitute(dataset))` in the _default argument_ of`name=...`, it is only evaluated at function definition time, not at call time.**  \n  At function definition, `dataset` is not bound to anything yet — so you get the *default value*.\n\nIn R, function _default arguments_ are lazily evaluated—**but only with respect to other arguments, not with respect to the actual call**. If you reference `dataset` in a default argument, and the function is called with e.g. an expression or a different kind of value, the substitution may not work as expected; it's not robust.\n\n---\n\n### The Recommended Solution\n\n**Set `name=NULL` and do the substitution _inside_ the function body**.\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  # ...rest of your function...\n  print(name)\n}\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```r\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n# prints \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\nThis ensures that `substitute(dataset)` returns the calling symbol the user typed, not the value.\n\n---\n\n#### Why does this work?\n\n- **Default arguments are only evaluated once when omitted, and `substitute()` only refers to the symbol literally passed in the call site.**\n- By evaluating `deparse(substitute(dataset))` _inside_ the function, you get the value passed _at call time_.\n\n---\n\n### Full Example\n\n```r\nlibrary(tibble)\n\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = \"log_dir\"  # Just a simple default for this example\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  cat(\"Name is:\", name, \"\\n\")\n  # ...rest of your code...\n}\n\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n#> Name is: simple_addition\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nMove the `deparse(substitute(dataset))` logic *inside* the function, in an `if (is.null(name)) ...` block.

Let's look at what happens:\n\n- **Case when argument is used with name:**  \n  `task_create(dataset = simple_addition)`  \n  Here, `substitute(dataset)` will yield the variable name (`simple_addition`).\n\n- **However, by placing `deparse(substitute(dataset))` in the _default argument_ of`name=...`, it is only evaluated at function definition time, not at call time.**  \n  At function definition, `dataset` is not bound to anything yet — so you get the *default value*.\n\nIn R, function _default arguments_ are lazily evaluated—**but only with respect to other arguments, not with respect to the actual call**. If you reference `dataset` in a default argument, and the function is called with e.g. an expression or a different kind of value, the substitution may not work as expected; it's not robust.\n\n---\n\n### The Recommended Solution\n\n**Set `name=NULL` and do the substitution _inside_ the function body**.\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  # ...rest of your function...\n  print(name)\n}\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```r\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n# prints \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\nThis ensures that `substitute(dataset)` returns the calling symbol the user typed, not the value.\n\n---\n\n#### Why does this work?\n\n- **Default arguments are only evaluated once when omitted, and `substitute()` only refers to the symbol literally passed in the call site.**\n- By evaluating `deparse(substitute(dataset))` _inside_ the function, you get the value passed _at call time_.\n\n---\n\n### Full Example\n\n```r\nlibrary(tibble)\n\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = NULL,\n    dir = \"log_dir\"  # Just a simple default for this example\n) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n  cat(\"Name is:\", name, \"\\n\")\n  # ...rest of your code...\n}\n\nsimple_addition <- tibble(\n  input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\", \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n#> Name is: simple_addition\n```\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nMove the `deparse(substitute(dataset))` logic *inside* the function, in an `if (is.null(name)) ...` block.

          "explanation": "The submission correctly identifies the core issue: using `NS(id)` inside a module server function creates namespace conflicts, and the solution is to use `session$ns` instead.\n\nThe explanation is comprehensive and accurate, showing that:\n\n1. The problem stems from incorrect namespace handling within the Shiny module system\n2. The specific fix is to replace `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns` in the innerServer function\n3. The submission provides a complete working solution with clear explanation about how namespacing works in Shiny modules\n\nThe submission addresses exactly what the criterion specifies - that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship, while `session$ns` ensures the dynamically generated UI elements have fully-qualified namespaces that properly match their corresponding server outputs.\n\nThe answer also provides additional context about module namespacing best practices that reinforces the core solution.\n\nGRADE: C",

But `NS(\"inner1\")(\"someTextGenerated\")` would yield `\"inner1-someTextGenerated\"`.  \n- **However**:  \n  When called from the outer module, it should be `\"outer1-inner1-someTextGenerated\"`!\n\nThis mismatch means that the `output$outer1-inner1-someTextGenerated` is **never assigned**, and therefore your `verbatimTextOutput` and `plotOutput` in the dynamic `UI` never get filled.\n\n---\n\n## **The Fix**\n\nIn your modules, **never call `NS()` in the server function** — just use the `session$ns`! This automatically handles the proper nesting.\n\n- In UI functions, use `ns <- NS(id)`\n- In server functions, use `ns <- session$ns`\n\nSo, your revised `innerServer` would be:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns   # <--- This is the key fix!\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot2::ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou **do not** need to change your UI code.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Takeaways**\n\n- In `*_UI`, use `ns <- NS(id)`\n- In `*_server`, use `ns <- session$ns`\n- Never use `NS()` inside a `moduleServer` body\n\n---\n\n## **Full Working Example**\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns   # <--- Fix here\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [Shiny modules reference (“The ns() function”)][1]\n\n[1]: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n> **Use `ns <- session$ns` in module server functions—not `NS(id)`!**  \nThat's what wires up the namespacing correctly for nesting."

This automatically handles the proper nesting.\n\n- In UI functions, use `ns <- NS(id)`\n- In server functions, use `ns <- session$ns`\n\nSo, your revised `innerServer` would be:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns   # <--- This is the key fix!\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot2::ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou **do not** need to change your UI code.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Takeaways**\n\n- In `*_UI`, use `ns <- NS(id)`\n- In `*_server`, use `ns <- session$ns`\n- Never use `NS()` inside a `moduleServer` body\n\n---\n\n## **Full Working Example**\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns   # <--- Fix here\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [Shiny modules reference (“The ns() function”)][1]\n\n[1]: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n> **Use `ns <- session$ns` in module server functions—not `NS(id)`!**  \nThat's what wires up the namespacing correctly for nesting.\n***\n[Criterion]: The issue is that `NS(id)` creates a new namespace function that doesn't\nmaintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules.

This automatically handles the proper nesting.\n\n- In UI functions, use `ns <- NS(id)`\n- In server functions, use `ns <- session$ns`\n\nSo, your revised `innerServer` would be:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns   # <--- This is the key fix!\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot2::ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggplot2::ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou **do not** need to change your UI code.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Takeaways**\n\n- In `*_UI`, use `ns <- NS(id)`\n- In `*_server`, use `ns <- session$ns`\n- Never use `NS()` inside a `moduleServer` body\n\n---\n\n## **Full Working Example**\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns   # <--- Fix here\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      theOutput <- ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n      theOutput\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [Shiny modules reference (“The ns() function”)][1]\n\n[1]: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n> **Use `ns <- session$ns` in module server functions—not `NS(id)`!**  \nThat's what wires up the namespacing correctly for nesting."

Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## What's the Problem?\n\n### R expects the **package name** (from `DESCRIPTION`) in your *Imports* field and, if not on CRAN, the **Remotes** field tells how to fetch it.\n\n*You have both correct:*  \n- `Imports: spatialstuff` (the canonical R package name)\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (the repo location)\n\nBut **pak** (set in your github actions by `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`) is stricter about resolving dependencies than `devtools::install_github()`. It tries to match the package and repo name, and sometimes case-sensitivity or mismatch in naming can trip it up.\n\n---\n\n## Why doesn't this work?\n\n- **pak** and **remotes** can have trouble if:\n  - The package name and GitHub repo name differ in case or spelling, especially if your system is case-sensitive.\n  - The Remote repo doesn't actually contain a package with the exact name that matches what's in `Imports`.\n  - There's some confusion in how `pak` is parsing the remotes.\n\n## What You Should Check\n\n### 1. **Check remote repo package structure**\n\nIn `org/spatial-Stuff`, check that:\n- There's a proper `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`\n- It's at the repo root (not a subdirectory)\n\n### 2. **Check for spelling or case errors**\n\n- The `Imports:` entry must match `Package:` field from that package's `DESCRIPTION` *case-sensitively*.\n- The `Remotes:` entry **must** match the Github repo *case-sensitively* (`org/spatial-Stuff`).\n\n### 3. **Check for multiple conflicting entries**\n\nSometimes you can have multiple remotes for the same package: e.g.,\n```\nRemotes:\n org/spatial-Stuff,\n anotherorg/spatialstuff\n```\nMake sure that's not the case.\n\n---\n\n## Potential Issue: **GitHub Package Name Casing and `pak`**\n\nIf the package name is `spatialstuff` (all lowercase), but the repository is `org/spatial-Stuff` (with dash and uppercase \"S\"), **pak** *should* handle this if the `DESCRIPTION` inside the repo has `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\nBut, on some systems (notably on case-sensitive file systems, or certain network setups), R and underlying tooling can be sensitive to the difference between `spatial-Stuff` and `spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations / Solutions\n\n1. **Double check the repo:**\n   - Can you install it manually with `pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`?\n   - Or with `remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`?\n   - Does that produce any errors? If so, is the package registered right (has a `NAMESPACE` as well)?\n\n2. **Try this Remotes syntax** if possible:\n   ```r\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n   (which you have).\n\n3. **If you're using a subdir** within the repo for the package:\n   ```r\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n   ```\n\n4. **Explicitly install dependencies**:  \n   In your workflow, add a step **before pkgdown** to install your Remotes using `pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` or `remotes::install_github()`.\n\n5. **Pin pak versions or use remotes**:  \n   Sometimes, newer versions of pak/remotes handle things better.

                  "text": "Let's break down the issue:\n\n## What's Happening\n\n- **Your `DESCRIPTION` lists**:  \n  ```\n  Imports: spatialstuff\n  Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n- **The actual package is** at `org/spatial-Stuff` (repo) but the package *name* (from its own `DESCRIPTION`) is `spatialstuff`.\n\n- **Error from CI/github actions** is:  \n  ```\n  Can't install dependency spatialstuff. Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## What's the Problem?\n\n### R expects the **package name** (from `DESCRIPTION`) in your *Imports* field and, if not on CRAN, the **Remotes** field tells how to fetch it.\n\n*You have both correct:*  \n- `Imports: spatialstuff` (the canonical R package name)\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (the repo location)\n\nBut **pak** (set in your github actions by `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`) is stricter about resolving dependencies than `devtools::install_github()`. It tries to match the package and repo name, and sometimes case-sensitivity or mismatch in naming can trip it up.\n\n---\n\n## Why doesn't this work?\n\n- **pak** and **remotes** can have trouble if:\n  - The package name and GitHub repo name differ in case or spelling, especially if your system is case-sensitive.\n  - The Remote repo doesn't actually contain a package with the exact name that matches what's in `Imports`.\n  - There's some confusion in how `pak` is parsing the remotes.\n\n## What You Should Check\n\n### 1. **Check remote repo package structure**\n\nIn `org/spatial-Stuff`, check that:\n- There's a proper `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`\n- It's at the repo root (not a subdirectory)\n\n### 2. **Check for spelling or case errors**\n\n- The `Imports:` entry must match `Package:` field from that package's `DESCRIPTION` *case-sensitively*.\n- The `Remotes:` entry **must** match the Github repo *case-sensitively* (`org/spatial-Stuff`).\n\n### 3. **Check for multiple conflicting entries**\n\nSometimes you can have multiple remotes for the same package: e.g.,\n```\nRemotes:\n org/spatial-Stuff,\n anotherorg/spatialstuff\n```\nMake sure that's not the case.\n\n---\n\n## Potential Issue: **GitHub Package Name Casing and `pak`**\n\nIf the package name is `spatialstuff` (all lowercase), but the repository is `org/spatial-Stuff` (with dash and uppercase \"S\"), **pak** *should* handle this if the `DESCRIPTION` inside the repo has `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\nBut, on some systems (notably on case-sensitive file systems, or certain network setups), R and underlying tooling can be sensitive to the difference between `spatial-Stuff` and `spatialstuff`.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations / Solutions\n\n1. **Double check the repo:**\n   - Can you install it manually with `pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`?\n   - Or with `remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")`?\n   - Does that produce any errors? If so, is the package registered right (has a `NAMESPACE` as well)?\n\n2. **Try this Remotes syntax** if possible:\n   ```r\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff\n   ```\n   (which you have).\n\n3. **If you're using a subdir** within the repo for the package:\n   ```r\n   Remotes:\n     org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n   ```\n\n4. **Explicitly install dependencies**:  \n   In your workflow, add a step **before pkgdown** to install your Remotes using `pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")` or `remotes::install_github()`.\n\n5. **Pin pak versions or use remotes**:  \n   Sometimes, newer versions of pak/remotes handle things better. Make sure your actions workflow uses latest versions.\n\n---\n\n## Typical GitHub Actions Issue\n\n- The default packaging workflows may not properly respect Remotes if you are using `pak` and your dependency is not on CRAN.  \n- Sometimes, using `remotes` works where `pak` does not, or vice versa.\n\n### To test, try tweaking your workflow before the setup step, for example:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install spatialstuff from GitHub\n  run: Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n```\nor\n```yaml\n- name: Install spatialstuff from GitHub\n  run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Step                               | What to verify                          |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| `DESCRIPTION` (Imports)             | `spatialstuff` (all lowercase)          |\n| `DESCRIPTION` (Remotes)             | `org/spatial-Stuff` (matches GitHub org/repo casing) |\n| Target repo `DESCRIPTION`           | `Package: spatialstuff`                 |\n| Manual install using pak/remotes    | Succeeds? Reveals any issues?           |\n| GitHub action pre-step              | Install dependency before pkgdown step  |\n\n---\n\n### If it still fails\n\n- Post your exact `DESCRIPTION` file and, if possible, a link to the repo or a smaller minimal example.\n- Consider using `remotes::install_github()` in the workflow until this resolves.\n\n---\n\n### **In summary**:\n- Your approach is broadly correct.\n- This is likely a quirk or issue in how `pak` is handling the case/repo/package name mismatch.\n- A workaround is to explicitly install the dependency with `pak` in the workflow before `pkgdown` runs, or switch to using `remotes` if that resolves the issue.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want a sample GitHub Actions workflow step or help debugging further!**",

Let's break down what's happening, and how to solve it.\n\n## **What's Happening?**\n\n### 1. **Package Name vs. GitHub Repository Name**\n- In your **DESCRIPTION**:  \n  ```\n  Imports:\n      spatialstuff\n  Remotes:\n      org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n  - `spatialstuff` is the *package name* (as defined in **its** DESCRIPTION, all lower-case).\n  - The code is *hosted* on GitHub at `org/spatial-Stuff` (mixed-case repo name).\n\n### 2. **How remotes** works\n- `remotes` and `pak` (used by `pkgdown` GitHub Actions) will try to find a package called `spatialstuff` by pulling it from `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- **Remotes** relies on your remote pointing to the repo, and the repo *containing a package with a matching package name*.\n\n### 3. **The error**\n- The pak/renv/remotes machinery **cannot find an installable package called `spatialstuff`** in the listed remotes, and so it fails with:\n  ```\n  Could not solve package dependencies:\n  deps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff\n  ...\n  spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## ****Why? Common Causes**\n\n#### 1. **Package name mismatch**\n- In the remote repo, in `DESCRIPTION`, is the package called `spatialstuff`? **It MUST match case.**  \n  R package names are **case-sensitive**—`spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff` are **different**.  \n  - *If the package is actually named* `spatial-Stuff`, *you must use that name* everywhere (Imports, etc).\n- If you `require(spatialstuff)`, it must match the `Package:` line **exactly** in their `DESCRIPTION`.\n\n#### 2. **Cached builds / binary artifacts / missing dependencies**\n- Not relevant unless you're using runners with preinstalled libraries.\n\n#### 3. **Non-standard repo layout**\n- Is `spatial-Stuff` a sub-folder or has anything inside that is not at root?\n\n---\n\n## **How to debug and fix**\n\n### **Step 1: Confirm Upstream Package Name**\n\nGo to: `https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION`\n\nLook for:\n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nor\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n- Whatever is after `Package:` is the ACTUAL package name.\n\n### **Step 2: Match everywhere**\n- In your `DESCRIPTION`, under `Imports` and all `NAMESPACE` usage, use **exactly that** name.\n\n### **Step 3: Remotes entry fine**\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` is correct for **GitHub username/repo**.\n- You **do not** use the package name here.\n\n### **Step 4: If the package is in a subdirectory**\nIf the package is not at root in the repo, you must specify:\n```\nRemotes: org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n```\nBut that's rare.\n\n### **Step 5: Check case sensitivity**\n- Windows is case-insensitive, but GitHub Actions/Unix is not.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion / Solution**\n\n### **What to fix?**\n- **Check the actual package name in the upstream DESCRIPTION.**\n- **Ensure you use the *exact* same spelling, including case, in your package's Imports and Remotes lines.**\n\n**Example:**  \nIf the upstream DESCRIPTION contains:\n```r\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nyour Imports must say:\n```r\nImports:\n    spatial-Stuff\n```\nand your Remotes:\n```\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n**If the package is actually `spatialstuff` (lowercase),** but the repo is `spatial-Stuff`, your lines are correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Debugging Locally**\n\n1.

Let's break down what's happening, and how to solve it.\n\n## **What's Happening?**\n\n### 1. **Package Name vs. GitHub Repository Name**\n- In your **DESCRIPTION**:  \n  ```\n  Imports:\n      spatialstuff\n  Remotes:\n      org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n  - `spatialstuff` is the *package name* (as defined in **its** DESCRIPTION, all lower-case).\n  - The code is *hosted* on GitHub at `org/spatial-Stuff` (mixed-case repo name).\n\n### 2. **How remotes** works\n- `remotes` and `pak` (used by `pkgdown` GitHub Actions) will try to find a package called `spatialstuff` by pulling it from `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- **Remotes** relies on your remote pointing to the repo, and the repo *containing a package with a matching package name*.\n\n### 3. **The error**\n- The pak/renv/remotes machinery **cannot find an installable package called `spatialstuff`** in the listed remotes, and so it fails with:\n  ```\n  Could not solve package dependencies:\n  deps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff\n  ...\n  spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## ****Why? Common Causes**\n\n#### 1. **Package name mismatch**\n- In the remote repo, in `DESCRIPTION`, is the package called `spatialstuff`? **It MUST match case.**  \n  R package names are **case-sensitive**—`spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff` are **different**.  \n  - *If the package is actually named* `spatial-Stuff`, *you must use that name* everywhere (Imports, etc).\n- If you `require(spatialstuff)`, it must match the `Package:` line **exactly** in their `DESCRIPTION`.\n\n#### 2. **Cached builds / binary artifacts / missing dependencies**\n- Not relevant unless you're using runners with preinstalled libraries.\n\n#### 3. **Non-standard repo layout**\n- Is `spatial-Stuff` a sub-folder or has anything inside that is not at root?\n\n---\n\n## **How to debug and fix**\n\n### **Step 1: Confirm Upstream Package Name**\n\nGo to: `https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION`\n\nLook for:\n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nor\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n- Whatever is after `Package:` is the ACTUAL package name.\n\n### **Step 2: Match everywhere**\n- In your `DESCRIPTION`, under `Imports` and all `NAMESPACE` usage, use **exactly that** name.\n\n### **Step 3: Remotes entry fine**\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` is correct for **GitHub username/repo**.\n- You **do not** use the package name here.\n\n### **Step 4: If the package is in a subdirectory**\nIf the package is not at root in the repo, you must specify:\n```\nRemotes: org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n```\nBut that's rare.\n\n### **Step 5: Check case sensitivity**\n- Windows is case-insensitive, but GitHub Actions/Unix is not.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion / Solution**\n\n### **What to fix?**\n- **Check the actual package name in the upstream DESCRIPTION.**\n- **Ensure you use the *exact* same spelling, including case, in your package's Imports and Remotes lines.**\n\n**Example:**  \nIf the upstream DESCRIPTION contains:\n```r\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nyour Imports must say:\n```r\nImports:\n    spatial-Stuff\n```\nand your Remotes:\n```\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n**If the package is actually `spatialstuff` (lowercase),** but the repo is `spatial-Stuff`, your lines are correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Debugging Locally**\n\n1. Try installing your package with `pak` (e.g. `pak::pkg_install(\".\")`) locally to see the error.\n2.

                  "text": "This is a nuanced R package development issue involving **Remotes**, package names, and GitHub Actions. Let's break down what's happening, and how to solve it.\n\n## **What's Happening?**\n\n### 1. **Package Name vs. GitHub Repository Name**\n- In your **DESCRIPTION**:  \n  ```\n  Imports:\n      spatialstuff\n  Remotes:\n      org/spatial-Stuff\n  ```\n  - `spatialstuff` is the *package name* (as defined in **its** DESCRIPTION, all lower-case).\n  - The code is *hosted* on GitHub at `org/spatial-Stuff` (mixed-case repo name).\n\n### 2. **How remotes** works\n- `remotes` and `pak` (used by `pkgdown` GitHub Actions) will try to find a package called `spatialstuff` by pulling it from `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n- **Remotes** relies on your remote pointing to the repo, and the repo *containing a package with a matching package name*.\n\n### 3. **The error**\n- The pak/renv/remotes machinery **cannot find an installable package called `spatialstuff`** in the listed remotes, and so it fails with:\n  ```\n  Could not solve package dependencies:\n  deps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff\n  ...\n  spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## ****Why? Common Causes**\n\n#### 1. **Package name mismatch**\n- In the remote repo, in `DESCRIPTION`, is the package called `spatialstuff`? **It MUST match case.**  \n  R package names are **case-sensitive**—`spatialstuff` and `spatial-Stuff` are **different**.  \n  - *If the package is actually named* `spatial-Stuff`, *you must use that name* everywhere (Imports, etc).\n- If you `require(spatialstuff)`, it must match the `Package:` line **exactly** in their `DESCRIPTION`.\n\n#### 2. **Cached builds / binary artifacts / missing dependencies**\n- Not relevant unless you're using runners with preinstalled libraries.\n\n#### 3. **Non-standard repo layout**\n- Is `spatial-Stuff` a sub-folder or has anything inside that is not at root?\n\n---\n\n## **How to debug and fix**\n\n### **Step 1: Confirm Upstream Package Name**\n\nGo to: `https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION`\n\nLook for:\n```\nPackage: spatialstuff\n```\nor\n```\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n- Whatever is after `Package:` is the ACTUAL package name.\n\n### **Step 2: Match everywhere**\n- In your `DESCRIPTION`, under `Imports` and all `NAMESPACE` usage, use **exactly that** name.\n\n### **Step 3: Remotes entry fine**\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` is correct for **GitHub username/repo**.\n- You **do not** use the package name here.\n\n### **Step 4: If the package is in a subdirectory**\nIf the package is not at root in the repo, you must specify:\n```\nRemotes: org/spatial-Stuff/subdir\n```\nBut that's rare.\n\n### **Step 5: Check case sensitivity**\n- Windows is case-insensitive, but GitHub Actions/Unix is not.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion / Solution**\n\n### **What to fix?**\n- **Check the actual package name in the upstream DESCRIPTION.**\n- **Ensure you use the *exact* same spelling, including case, in your package's Imports and Remotes lines.**\n\n**Example:**  \nIf the upstream DESCRIPTION contains:\n```r\nPackage: spatial-Stuff\n```\nyour Imports must say:\n```r\nImports:\n    spatial-Stuff\n```\nand your Remotes:\n```\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n\n**If the package is actually `spatialstuff` (lowercase),** but the repo is `spatial-Stuff`, your lines are correct.\n\n---\n\n## **Debugging Locally**\n\n1. Try installing your package with `pak` (e.g. `pak::pkg_install(\".\")`) locally to see the error.\n2. Try installing just the dependency manually:  \n   ```r\n   pak::pkg_install(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n   ```\n   - What is the installed package called? Use `installed.packages()` to check.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| What to check            | Correct value            | Where          |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| Package name (in Imports)| Must match `Package:` in upstream DESCRIPTION | Your DESCRIPTION |\n| Remotes                  | `org/repo`              | Your DESCRIPTION |\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n- **This is a user error most likely caused by a package name mismatch.**\n- Recheck the `Package:` field in the dependency's `DESCRIPTION`.\n- Use that name **with the exact case** in your Imports.\n- The `Remotes` entry is the GitHub \"owner/repo\" and is independent of case (except for the actual repo owner/repo spelling).\n- If this doesn't solve the problem, paste contents of the dependency's DESCRIPTION for further help!\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you paste the actual `DESCRIPTION` and I can double-check!**",

How Remotes works\n\nThe `Remotes:` field in `DESCRIPTION` tells `pak` (and `devtools`, etc.) to **install the package named** `spatialstuff` from **org/spatial-Stuff** (the repo on GitHub).\n\n**But:**  \nFor this to work, your target repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) must actually be an R package called `spatialstuff` in its own `DESCRIPTION` file (`Package: spatialstuff`).  \n- It sounds like this is true, per your statement.\n\n### 2. The problem: case-sensitivity\n\n- **R package names are case-insensitive.**\n- **GitHub repo names are case-insensitive**, but the **way you specify them in Remotes is case-sensitive to match the URL**.\n- On many filesystems (not all), clones will succeed for different capitalizations, but on Linux runners, sometimes there will be a problem cloning and finding the actual R package code.\n\n### 3. Why is the error appearing?\n\n#### A. If the repo is public and properly-formatted:\n\n- The typical error here indicates the workflow tried to `pak` (or `remotes`) install `spatialstuff`, but _couldn't find the package source_.\n- Most likely: **pak tried to install from CRAN**, but it isn’t on CRAN, so it falls back to Remotes.\n- If Remotes fails—for example due to a capitalization or URL problem—it can't find the package.\n\n#### B. Inconsistent/incorrect Remotes format\n\nThe `Remotes:` field should be in standard GitHub format: `user/repo`.\n\n- The repo could be `spatial-Stuff` but the **package** inside must be called `spatialstuff`.\n- Case sensitivity of the repo name matters for the URL, not the package name.\n- You can use:  \n  ```\n  Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n  Imports: spatialstuff\n  ```\n  This should work if the repo contains `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### C. GitHub workflow uses `pak` and/or `remotes`\n\n- These tools _should_ follow Remotes instructions correctly, but\n- If the actual repo isn't accessible (private repo without token, typo, or capitalization error), you'll get \"Can't find package\" errors.\n\n## How to troubleshoot and fix\n\n### 1. Check that Remotes points exactly to the correct repo\n\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (should be correct if the repo is [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff))\n- Make sure this repo is **public** or your workflow has the required [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\n\n### 2. Check that the package inside is called `spatialstuff`\n\n- In `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` the line must be exactly:  \n  ```\n  Package: spatialstuff\n  ```\n\n### 3. Ensure there are no typos or extra whitespace\n\n- Even trailing spaces or extra comments can cause parsing issues.\n\n### 4. In your workflow, confirm installation commands\n\n- pkgdown actions generated by `usethis` use the `pak` package for installation, which supports Remotes.\n- But sometimes **case mismatches in repo/user names can cause 404s**.\n\n### 5. Try manual install to replicate\n\nOn your own system, try:\n\n```r\npak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nOr\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\n- If these fail with the same message, you know it's a Remotes/repo issue—**not a pkgdown workflow issue**.\n\n### 6.

How Remotes works\n\nThe `Remotes:` field in `DESCRIPTION` tells `pak` (and `devtools`, etc.) to **install the package named** `spatialstuff` from **org/spatial-Stuff** (the repo on GitHub).\n\n**But:**  \nFor this to work, your target repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) must actually be an R package called `spatialstuff` in its own `DESCRIPTION` file (`Package: spatialstuff`).  \n- It sounds like this is true, per your statement.\n\n### 2. The problem: case-sensitivity\n\n- **R package names are case-insensitive.**\n- **GitHub repo names are case-insensitive**, but the **way you specify them in Remotes is case-sensitive to match the URL**.\n- On many filesystems (not all), clones will succeed for different capitalizations, but on Linux runners, sometimes there will be a problem cloning and finding the actual R package code.\n\n### 3. Why is the error appearing?\n\n#### A. If the repo is public and properly-formatted:\n\n- The typical error here indicates the workflow tried to `pak` (or `remotes`) install `spatialstuff`, but _couldn't find the package source_.\n- Most likely: **pak tried to install from CRAN**, but it isn’t on CRAN, so it falls back to Remotes.\n- If Remotes fails—for example due to a capitalization or URL problem—it can't find the package.\n\n#### B. Inconsistent/incorrect Remotes format\n\nThe `Remotes:` field should be in standard GitHub format: `user/repo`.\n\n- The repo could be `spatial-Stuff` but the **package** inside must be called `spatialstuff`.\n- Case sensitivity of the repo name matters for the URL, not the package name.\n- You can use:  \n  ```\n  Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n  Imports: spatialstuff\n  ```\n  This should work if the repo contains `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### C. GitHub workflow uses `pak` and/or `remotes`\n\n- These tools _should_ follow Remotes instructions correctly, but\n- If the actual repo isn't accessible (private repo without token, typo, or capitalization error), you'll get \"Can't find package\" errors.\n\n## How to troubleshoot and fix\n\n### 1. Check that Remotes points exactly to the correct repo\n\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (should be correct if the repo is [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff))\n- Make sure this repo is **public** or your workflow has the required [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\n\n### 2. Check that the package inside is called `spatialstuff`\n\n- In `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` the line must be exactly:  \n  ```\n  Package: spatialstuff\n  ```\n\n### 3. Ensure there are no typos or extra whitespace\n\n- Even trailing spaces or extra comments can cause parsing issues.\n\n### 4.

How Remotes works\n\nThe `Remotes:` field in `DESCRIPTION` tells `pak` (and `devtools`, etc.) to **install the package named** `spatialstuff` from **org/spatial-Stuff** (the repo on GitHub).\n\n**But:**  \nFor this to work, your target repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) must actually be an R package called `spatialstuff` in its own `DESCRIPTION` file (`Package: spatialstuff`).  \n- It sounds like this is true, per your statement.\n\n### 2. The problem: case-sensitivity\n\n- **R package names are case-insensitive.**\n- **GitHub repo names are case-insensitive**, but the **way you specify them in Remotes is case-sensitive to match the URL**.\n- On many filesystems (not all), clones will succeed for different capitalizations, but on Linux runners, sometimes there will be a problem cloning and finding the actual R package code.\n\n### 3. Why is the error appearing?\n\n#### A. If the repo is public and properly-formatted:\n\n- The typical error here indicates the workflow tried to `pak` (or `remotes`) install `spatialstuff`, but _couldn't find the package source_.\n- Most likely: **pak tried to install from CRAN**, but it isn’t on CRAN, so it falls back to Remotes.\n- If Remotes fails—for example due to a capitalization or URL problem—it can't find the package.\n\n#### B. Inconsistent/incorrect Remotes format\n\nThe `Remotes:` field should be in standard GitHub format: `user/repo`.\n\n- The repo could be `spatial-Stuff` but the **package** inside must be called `spatialstuff`.\n- Case sensitivity of the repo name matters for the URL, not the package name.\n- You can use:  \n  ```\n  Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n  Imports: spatialstuff\n  ```\n  This should work if the repo contains `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### C. GitHub workflow uses `pak` and/or `remotes`\n\n- These tools _should_ follow Remotes instructions correctly, but\n- If the actual repo isn't accessible (private repo without token, typo, or capitalization error), you'll get \"Can't find package\" errors.\n\n## How to troubleshoot and fix\n\n### 1. Check that Remotes points exactly to the correct repo\n\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (should be correct if the repo is [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff))\n- Make sure this repo is **public** or your workflow has the required [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\n\n### 2. Check that the package inside is called `spatialstuff`\n\n- In `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` the line must be exactly:  \n  ```\n  Package: spatialstuff\n  ```\n\n### 3. Ensure there are no typos or extra whitespace\n\n- Even trailing spaces or extra comments can cause parsing issues.\n\n### 4. In your workflow, confirm installation commands\n\n- pkgdown actions generated by `usethis` use the `pak` package for installation, which supports Remotes.\n- But sometimes **case mismatches in repo/user names can cause 404s**.\n\n### 5. Try manual install to replicate\n\nOn your own system, try:\n\n```r\npak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nOr\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\n- If these fail with the same message, you know it's a Remotes/repo issue—**not a pkgdown workflow issue**.\n\n### 6.

How Remotes works\n\nThe `Remotes:` field in `DESCRIPTION` tells `pak` (and `devtools`, etc.) to **install the package named** `spatialstuff` from **org/spatial-Stuff** (the repo on GitHub).\n\n**But:**  \nFor this to work, your target repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) must actually be an R package called `spatialstuff` in its own `DESCRIPTION` file (`Package: spatialstuff`).  \n- It sounds like this is true, per your statement.\n\n### 2. The problem: case-sensitivity\n\n- **R package names are case-insensitive.**\n- **GitHub repo names are case-insensitive**, but the **way you specify them in Remotes is case-sensitive to match the URL**.\n- On many filesystems (not all), clones will succeed for different capitalizations, but on Linux runners, sometimes there will be a problem cloning and finding the actual R package code.\n\n### 3. Why is the error appearing?\n\n#### A. If the repo is public and properly-formatted:\n\n- The typical error here indicates the workflow tried to `pak` (or `remotes`) install `spatialstuff`, but _couldn't find the package source_.\n- Most likely: **pak tried to install from CRAN**, but it isn’t on CRAN, so it falls back to Remotes.\n- If Remotes fails—for example due to a capitalization or URL problem—it can't find the package.\n\n#### B. Inconsistent/incorrect Remotes format\n\nThe `Remotes:` field should be in standard GitHub format: `user/repo`.\n\n- The repo could be `spatial-Stuff` but the **package** inside must be called `spatialstuff`.\n- Case sensitivity of the repo name matters for the URL, not the package name.\n- You can use:  \n  ```\n  Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n  Imports: spatialstuff\n  ```\n  This should work if the repo contains `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### C.

Check that Remotes points exactly to the correct repo\n\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (should be correct if the repo is [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff))\n- Make sure this repo is **public** or your workflow has the required [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\n\n### 2. Check that the package inside is called `spatialstuff`\n\n- In `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` the line must be exactly:  \n  ```\n  Package: spatialstuff\n  ```\n\n### 3. Ensure there are no typos or extra whitespace\n\n- Even trailing spaces or extra comments can cause parsing issues.\n\n### 4. In your workflow, confirm installation commands\n\n- pkgdown actions generated by `usethis` use the `pak` package for installation, which supports Remotes.\n- But sometimes **case mismatches in repo/user names can cause 404s**.\n\n### 5. Try manual install to replicate\n\nOn your own system, try:\n\n```r\npak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nOr\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\n- If these fail with the same message, you know it's a Remotes/repo issue—**not a pkgdown workflow issue**.\n\n### 6.

                  "text": "Let's break down this problem and what's really happening:\n\n## What's Going Wrong?\n\nYou have:\n\n- **A package** that `Imports: spatialstuff` in `DESCRIPTION`.\n- **In Remotes**: you point at `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\nBut the repo name on GitHub is **org/spatial-Stuff** (note the capitalization and the hyphen).\n\nYou're seeing this error in the pkgdown GitHub Actions workflow:\n\n```\nCould not solve package dependencies:\ndeps::.: Can't install dependency spatialstuff\n* spatialstuff: Can't find package called spatialstuff.\n```\n\n## Step-by-step explanation\n\n### 1. How Remotes works\n\nThe `Remotes:` field in `DESCRIPTION` tells `pak` (and `devtools`, etc.) to **install the package named** `spatialstuff` from **org/spatial-Stuff** (the repo on GitHub).\n\n**But:**  \nFor this to work, your target repo (`org/spatial-Stuff`) must actually be an R package called `spatialstuff` in its own `DESCRIPTION` file (`Package: spatialstuff`).  \n- It sounds like this is true, per your statement.\n\n### 2. The problem: case-sensitivity\n\n- **R package names are case-insensitive.**\n- **GitHub repo names are case-insensitive**, but the **way you specify them in Remotes is case-sensitive to match the URL**.\n- On many filesystems (not all), clones will succeed for different capitalizations, but on Linux runners, sometimes there will be a problem cloning and finding the actual R package code.\n\n### 3. Why is the error appearing?\n\n#### A. If the repo is public and properly-formatted:\n\n- The typical error here indicates the workflow tried to `pak` (or `remotes`) install `spatialstuff`, but _couldn't find the package source_.\n- Most likely: **pak tried to install from CRAN**, but it isn’t on CRAN, so it falls back to Remotes.\n- If Remotes fails—for example due to a capitalization or URL problem—it can't find the package.\n\n#### B. Inconsistent/incorrect Remotes format\n\nThe `Remotes:` field should be in standard GitHub format: `user/repo`.\n\n- The repo could be `spatial-Stuff` but the **package** inside must be called `spatialstuff`.\n- Case sensitivity of the repo name matters for the URL, not the package name.\n- You can use:  \n  ```\n  Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff\n  Imports: spatialstuff\n  ```\n  This should work if the repo contains `DESCRIPTION` with `Package: spatialstuff`.\n\n#### C. GitHub workflow uses `pak` and/or `remotes`\n\n- These tools _should_ follow Remotes instructions correctly, but\n- If the actual repo isn't accessible (private repo without token, typo, or capitalization error), you'll get \"Can't find package\" errors.\n\n## How to troubleshoot and fix\n\n### 1. Check that Remotes points exactly to the correct repo\n\n- `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff` (should be correct if the repo is [https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff](https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff))\n- Make sure this repo is **public** or your workflow has the required [PAT (Personal Access Token)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).\n\n### 2. Check that the package inside is called `spatialstuff`\n\n- In `org/spatial-Stuff/DESCRIPTION` the line must be exactly:  \n  ```\n  Package: spatialstuff\n  ```\n\n### 3. Ensure there are no typos or extra whitespace\n\n- Even trailing spaces or extra comments can cause parsing issues.\n\n### 4. In your workflow, confirm installation commands\n\n- pkgdown actions generated by `usethis` use the `pak` package for installation, which supports Remotes.\n- But sometimes **case mismatches in repo/user names can cause 404s**.\n\n### 5. Try manual install to replicate\n\nOn your own system, try:\n\n```r\npak::pak(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\nOr\n```r\ndevtools::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")\n```\n- If these fail with the same message, you know it's a Remotes/repo issue—**not a pkgdown workflow issue**.\n\n### 6. (If Organization Name Has Capitals...)\n\nIf your org/user's name has capitals, you **must** match the GitHub username/repo case in Remotes.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Field      | Value                | Should be:                                    |\n|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Imports    | `spatialstuff`       | Lowercase, matches package \"Package: spatialstuff\" |\n| Remotes    | `org/spatial-Stuff`  | *Exact* GitHub user/repo name                 |\n| GitHub Repo| `org/spatial-Stuff`  | Contains a valid R package                    |\n| Package    | `spatialstuff`       | Lowercase in DESCRIPTION                      |\n\n---\n\n## **Common Failure Points**\n\n- **Repo is private**: Set GITHUB_TOKEN in workflow.\n- **Typo/case in Remotes**: Must exactly match GitHub URL.\n- **Wrong package name in DESCRIPTION**: Package must be `spatialstuff`, not `spatial-Stuff`.\n- **GitHub out of sync**: Your Remotes points to stale or wrong repo.\n- **Network issues**: Runner can't reach GitHub.\n\n---\n\n## **What to do next**\n\n- Double check all the steps and naming above.\n- Try manual install as in (5).\n- If still failing, post your minimal `DESCRIPTION` and command that reproduces the error.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary (Short)**\n\nIt's almost certainly **not a bug in pkgdown or usethis**.\nThe error means that either:\n- The Remotes repo isn't accessible\n- The Remotes field has typo/case error so it can't fetch it\n- Or the repo doesn't actually contain an R package named `spatialstuff`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nCarefully check Remotes for exact user/repo name and that the target repo exports `Package: spatialstuff`.

This error comes from a mismatch between **dynamically assigning methods** in the R6 `initialize` method and **declaring them in the class definition**. Let's break down **what's happening** and _why you get the error_, then explain some fixes.\n\n### **What's Happening?**\n\n- In `Parent`, during `initialize`, you do `self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {...}`.  \n- In `Child`, you **also declare** a `foo()` in the `public` list.\n\nWhen you create a `Child` object, **the `Parent`'s `initialize()` runs**, and tries to set `self$foo` — but by then, in `Child`, R6 has already made `foo` a locked binding (because it was part of the class definition).  \n\nSo, dynamically changing `self$foo` in `Parent` fails if it's declared in `Child`.  \nThat's why you see:  \n> `cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'`\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix?**\n\nYou **should not mix** dynamic method definition (inside `initialize`) with static ones (in the `public` list) for the same method name.  \n**Chose one method.**\n\n---\n\n### **1.

                  "text": "Great question! This error comes from a mismatch between **dynamically assigning methods** in the R6 `initialize` method and **declaring them in the class definition**. Let's break down **what's happening** and _why you get the error_, then explain some fixes.\n\n### **What's Happening?**\n\n- In `Parent`, during `initialize`, you do `self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {...}`.  \n- In `Child`, you **also declare** a `foo()` in the `public` list.\n\nWhen you create a `Child` object, **the `Parent`'s `initialize()` runs**, and tries to set `self$foo` — but by then, in `Child`, R6 has already made `foo` a locked binding (because it was part of the class definition).  \n\nSo, dynamically changing `self$foo` in `Parent` fails if it's declared in `Child`.  \nThat's why you see:  \n> `cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'`\n\n---\n\n## **How to Fix?**\n\nYou **should not mix** dynamic method definition (inside `initialize`) with static ones (in the `public` list) for the same method name.  \n**Chose one method.**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Declare `foo` Statically Everywhere**\n\nThe most robust:  \n- Put `foo = function(...)` in `Parent`'s `public` list (not in `initialize`!)  \n- You can then override it in `Child` safely.\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {},\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. If You *Must* Assign Dynamically, Don't Redeclare in Child**\n\nIf `foo` is always dynamic, *don't* put `foo` in `Child$public` either.  \nCall `self$foo()` as a function property, not a method.\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      super$initialize()\n      # Optionally, wrap/modify self$foo here if needed\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n#> [1] \"foo\"\n```\n\nTo override, you would have to ***dynamically reassign it*** in Child's `initialize` as well.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Method                  | Parent `foo` Declaration | Child Override | Outcome                |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|------------------------|\n| Both in `public` list   | Yes                     | Yes           | Works, can override    |\n| Dynamic in `initialize` | Yes                     | No            | Works as dynamic       |\n| Mix (your example)      | Dynamic in Parent       | public in Kid | **Error!**             |\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n\n**Declare methods in the `public` list if you ever want to override them.**  \nUse dynamic assignment only for rare, advanced cases.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**\nMove `foo` to the `public` list of `Parent`.  \n*Do NOT assign to `self$foo` in `initialize` if you plan to override it in subclasses.*",

The criterion specifically states that to change a locked binding, one should use `unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)` before assigning the method. This approach would allow the dynamic method creation to work even in inherited classes by explicitly unlocking the binding before reassignment.\n\nSince the submission doesn't mention this specific solution involving `unlockBinding()`, it doesn't meet the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

                  "text": "The error\n\n```\n! promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference or earlier problems?\n```\n\nindicates that there is a **recursive default argument reference**: you're using a default argument (`chat`) that refers to itself, directly or indirectly, within nested function definitions.\n\nLet's look at your code:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) { # <-- (A)\n    ch <- chat$clone()           # uses 'chat'\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, in your **inner function**, the default value for `chat` is set to `chat`, as in `chat = chat`.  \nBut *which* `chat`? In R, a default argument is evaluated in the environment **after** function arguments are assigned, i.e., in the frame where the function is called, but if the default refers to the argument itself (\"`chat = chat`\"), it creates a loop: \"`chat` is `chat`, which is `chat`, ...\", hence the error.\n\n---\n\n## The Fix\n\n### 1. Capture the Outer `chat` in the Inner Function's Environment\n\nMost typically, this pattern is done with \"lazy\" evaluation or using function closures.  \nYou **don't need** to give the inner function a default for `chat` like this.\n\nJust do:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    ch <- if (is.null(chat_override)) chat$clone() else chat_override$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Now the inner function refers to the outer-scope `chat` (\"lexical scoping\").\n- If you want to allow passing in a *different* `chat`, you can do so via the new `chat_override` argument.\n\n### 2. If you actually want to allow overriding `chat`, but default to the captured one:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    cur_chat <- if (is.null(chat_override)) chat else chat_override\n    ch <- cur_chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nIf you want the argument to still be named `chat`, just don't set a default that self-references!  \n**Never do:** `function(chat = chat)`\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**Don't set a default argument to itself!**  \nThis makes an infinite promise and creates the error you saw.\n\n**Use closure/capture from outer scope instead**:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr, if you want to allow override:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_override = NULL) {\n    cch <- if (is.null(chat_override)) chat else chat_override\n    ch <- cch$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n**Change**\n\n```r\nfunction(input, chat = chat) { ... }\n```\n\n**TO**\n\n```r\nfunction(input) { ... } # and use 'chat' from outer scope\n```\n\nor\n\n```r\nfunction(input, chat_override = NULL) { ... }\n```\n\n**Don't refer to a parameter in its own default value!**",

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe error:\n\n```\n! promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference or earlier problems?\n```\n\noccurs because in **R**, default arguments in function definitions are evaluated at the time the function is *called* (not when defined). If a default argument refers to a parameter or variable of the enclosing function environment **with the same name**, it triggers a recursive reference, leading to the promise evaluation error.\n\nLook at your code:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInside the **inner** function, the parameter `chat`'s default is `chat` (the outer variable).  \nWhen R tries to resolve the default value for `chat`, it needs the value of `chat` from the outer function, but at the same time it's assigning a default to `chat` in the inner scope. This creates exactly the circular problem R is warning about.\n\n## How to Fix\n\n**Don't set a default value to a function argument that refers to an argument in the enclosing function of the same name.**\n\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n\n### 1.

Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe error:\n\n```\n! promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference or earlier problems?\n```\n\noccurs because in **R**, default arguments in function definitions are evaluated at the time the function is *called* (not when defined). If a default argument refers to a parameter or variable of the enclosing function environment **with the same name**, it triggers a recursive reference, leading to the promise evaluation error.\n\nLook at your code:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  \n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInside the **inner** function, the parameter `chat`'s default is `chat` (the outer variable).  \nWhen R tries to resolve the default value for `chat`, it needs the value of `chat` from the outer function, but at the same time it's assigning a default to `chat` in the inner scope. This creates exactly the circular problem R is warning about.\n\n## How to Fix\n\n**Don't set a default value to a function argument that refers to an argument in the enclosing function of the same name.**\n\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n\n### 1. Use a different argument name\n\nRename the argument in the inner function:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_instance = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_instance$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, `chat_instance` defaults to the outer `chat`. No recursive reference.\n\n### 2. Use `force()` to capture `chat` in a closure\n\nIf you want the inner function to always use the captured `chat` from the outer environment (the instance at runtime of `generate()`), don't make `chat` an argument to the inner function:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)  # Ensure 'chat' is evaluated now\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow the inner function simply \"remembers\" whatever `chat` was when `generate()` was called, and can't be overridden.\n\n### 3. Default to NULL, Substitute If Needed\n\nIf you want to allow overriding, but avoid the recursive promise, do:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)\n  function(input, chat_inner = NULL) {\n    ch_obj <- if (is.null(chat_inner)) chat else chat_inner\n    ch <- ch_obj$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- Don't use a default argument that refers to an argument of the same name in the outer function.\n- Change the inner argument's name **or**\n- Remove it completely and use closure **or**\n- Use `NULL` default and substitute.\n\n---\n\n**Pick the version that matches intended behavior.**  \nFor most idiomatic R code, **option 1** (different inner argument name) is the cleanest.\n\n---\n\n**References:**  \n- [Advanced R: Default Arguments](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html#default-arguments)\n\n---\n\n**Example of working code (option 1):**\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_instance = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_instance$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a more detailed explanation or example!"

It uses the `{?s}` syntax to conditionally add an \"s\" based on the quantity of missing parameters. It also uses `cli::qty()` to set the context for pluralization.\n\nWhile the exact formatting is slightly different from the example criterion (it uses `{?s}` instead of the more elaborate `{?is/are}` pattern shown in the criterion), this is still a valid approach to pluralization in the cli package. The submission also includes `.envir = environment()` which is appropriate but not required in the criterion.\n\nThe submitted code properly handles the display of missing parameter IDs and uses the CLI package's automatic comma-separated formatting for vectors.\n\nOverall, the submission successfully meets all the required criteria.\n\nGRADE: C"

          "explanation": "I'll assess whether the submission correctly addresses the criterion regarding the `output$plot` issue in the Shiny app.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core problem: the server-side logic is defined globally outside the server function, causing the \"Can't read output 'plot'\" error. The solution provided in the submission moves all the reactive code (including `filtered_data` and `output$plot`) into the server function, which is the correct approach.\n\nThe submission includes a complete, fixed solution that:\n1. Creates a proper server function\n2. Moves all reactive expressions inside this function\n3. Properly references input values within the server context\n4. Sets up the proper `shinyApp(ui, server)` structure\n\nThe solution is comprehensive and addresses all the issues related to the error message in the original code. The submission even adds some additional improvements like a proper check for enough data rows and better organization of the code.\n\nThis solution aligns well with the criterion, which specifies moving the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function. The submission does exactly that, with a bit more detail and explanation.\n\nGRADE: C",

The solution provided in the submission moves all the reactive code (including `filtered_data` and `output$plot`) into the server function, which is the correct approach.\n\nThe submission includes a complete, fixed solution that:\n1. Creates a proper server function\n2. Moves all reactive expressions inside this function\n3. Properly references input values within the server context\n4. Sets up the proper `shinyApp(ui, server)` structure\n\nThe solution is comprehensive and addresses all the issues related to the error message in the original code. The submission even adds some additional improvements like a proper check for enough data rows and better organization of the code.\n\nThis solution aligns well with the criterion, which specifies moving the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function.

The error you're seeing:\n```\nError in output$plot : Can't read output 'plot'\n```\ncomes from a **misunderstanding about where code should live** in the Shiny app structure.\n\n**Key issues in your code:**\n\n### 1. Output Assignments Must Happen in the `server` Function\n\nAll your `reactive` expressions and the `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` are **outside** the `server` function. This means they do **not** have access to the `input` and `output` objects, which only exist inside the `server` function.\n\n### 2. The `server` function needs to define the app's reactivity\n\nYou need to put your `reactive`s and `output$plot` definition **inside** the `server` function.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\nRewrite the structure as follows:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Reactives go in the server!\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) return(NULL)  # Avoid errors if no data\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary of what I changed:**\n- Moved **all reactive code and output assignments into the `server` function**.\n- Removed attempts to use `.shinyoutput` outside of server.\n- Removed the redundant `ckd_condition` and `visit_threshold` reactives (just use `input$...` directly).\n\nIf you are loading your data in-app and it is not too large, keep that in the global section.\nIf you want multi-user scalability, load, process, or subset your data inside `server`.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [Shiny \"Can't read output\" error explanation](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1636)\n- [Shiny App Structure](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson2/)\n\n---\n\nTry this structure. Your error should disappear! 🚦\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution\nis to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function,\nlike:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

Moves all reactive expressions inside the server function\n2. Includes the full `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` code inside the server function\n3. Structures the server function properly to handle the inputs and outputs\n4. Simplifies some of the reactive expressions by using `input$condition` directly\n5. Includes appropriate error handling\n\nThis solution directly addresses the criterion, which identified that the `output$plot` needed to be moved into a proper server function with all the appropriate rendering code. The solution even goes a bit beyond by adding additional error handling (checking for empty data frames).\n\nThe submission's solution is functionally equivalent to the one described in the criterion, though it uses a slightly different approach in some places (including the `session` parameter and some additional error handling).\n\nGRADE: C",

Right now, your `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` is *not* inside your `shinyApp()`'s server function—it's outside, so it can't access `input` or `output` and doesn't actually register the output in the app.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem 2: Reactives and input access outside server**\n\nYou have:\n```r\nckd_condition <- reactive({\n  input$condition\n})\n```\nBut outside of the server, `input` is not available. You must define **all reactives (and all code using `input`) inside the server function**.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem 3: Minor mistakes in how you use reactives**\n\nYou use `filtered_data()` inside the plot, but the object `filtered_data` is not in the correct scope due to the above issues.\n\nAlso, your filtering line:\n```r\nfilter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold)\n```\nshould have `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()` if those are reactives.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix**\n\nHere is how you should structure your app:\n\n**1. Load data and pre-process in global**\n**2. All reactives and output declarations go inside server**\n**3. Do *not* use reactives outside server**\n\n---\n\n## **Rewritten Correct App**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Preprocess Data in the Global Scope\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"No data for this selection\")\n      return()\n    }\n    # Make sure both variables are present:\n    if (!all(c(\"Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED\", \"VISIT_COUNT\") %in% colnames(data))) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"Expected columns not found.\")\n      return()\n    }\n\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Fixes**\n1. **Output and reactives are defined inside the server function.**\n2. **Inputs accessed via `input$variable`, not reactives outside server.**\n3. **Added checks for empty data or missing columns.**\n4. **App should now work without errors.**\n\n---\n\n**If you still get errors, check your data's column names (`Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED` and `VISIT_COUNT`).

                  "text": "Let's break down the issues in your code:\n\n---\n\n## **Problem 1: You declared **`output$plot`** in the **global** environment**\n\nYou **must declare all output render functions inside** your `server` function in Shiny, so the `input` and `output` variables will work. Right now, your `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` is *not* inside your `shinyApp()`'s server function—it's outside, so it can't access `input` or `output` and doesn't actually register the output in the app.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem 2: Reactives and input access outside server**\n\nYou have:\n```r\nckd_condition <- reactive({\n  input$condition\n})\n```\nBut outside of the server, `input` is not available. You must define **all reactives (and all code using `input`) inside the server function**.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem 3: Minor mistakes in how you use reactives**\n\nYou use `filtered_data()` inside the plot, but the object `filtered_data` is not in the correct scope due to the above issues.\n\nAlso, your filtering line:\n```r\nfilter(CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition, VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold)\n```\nshould have `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()` if those are reactives.\n\n---\n\n## **How to fix**\n\nHere is how you should structure your app:\n\n**1. Load data and pre-process in global**\n**2. All reactives and output declarations go inside server**\n**3. Do *not* use reactives outside server**\n\n---\n\n## **Rewritten Correct App**\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Preprocess Data in the Global Scope\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    data <- filtered_data()\n    if (nrow(data) == 0) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"No data for this selection\")\n      return()\n    }\n    # Make sure both variables are present:\n    if (!all(c(\"Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED\", \"VISIT_COUNT\") %in% colnames(data))) {\n      plot.new()\n      text(0.5, 0.5, \"Expected columns not found.\")\n      return()\n    }\n\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of Fixes**\n1. **Output and reactives are defined inside the server function.**\n2. **Inputs accessed via `input$variable`, not reactives outside server.**\n3. **Added checks for empty data or missing columns.**\n4. **App should now work without errors.**\n\n---\n\n**If you still get errors, check your data's column names (`Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED` and `VISIT_COUNT`). Adjust them if needed to match your spreadsheet.**\n\n---\n\n### **References**\n- [Shiny - Structure of a Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/app-structure.html)\n- [Shiny - Reactivity](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if it works!

Instead, handle missing fields directly as needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nReplace all `$refresh_token` with `[['refresh_token']]` in this context to avoid partial matching.\n***\n[Criterion]: Change `out$refresh_token <- out$refresh_token %||% refresh_token` to \n`out[[\"refresh_token\"]] <- out[[\"refresh_token\"]] %||% refresh_token`. \n\nNo other changes needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

You’ve stumbled on a subtlety of R package development, **dplyr**’s internals, and namespace management.\n\nLet’s summarize and solve:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **`closest()` is not exported by dplyr**\n\n`dplyr` uses `closest()` as a helper function **internally** (e.g. for approximate matching with names), but it is **not part of dplyr’s public API** (see: [dplyr namespace](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/NAMESPACE)). That means:\n\n- You **can** call `closest()` if it’s in your package’s imports or if it’s attached (via `library(dplyr)`).\n- You **cannot** refer to it as `dplyr::closest()` because it’s **not exported**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Why does calling `closest()` work in your package?**\n\nIf your package **Imports:** dplyr, its **namespace will import ALL (even hidden) dplyr functions** for use within your package, unless you restrict imports using `importFrom()` in your NAMESPACE. So, _bare_ `closest()` works **inside your package code**.\n\nHowever, linters or R CMD check will (correctly) warn about:\n- **Non-exported functions**,\n- Namespace pollution,\n- Future incompatibility (internal dplyr function can change or disappear without notice).\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Proper solutions**\n\n### **A) Copy or Reimplement the Function**\n\nIf you rely on `closest()` for basic fuzzy matching or name suggestion, **best practice is to copy/adapt the logic** into your own package. For example:\n\n```r\n#' Find the closest match in a set of choices\nclosest <- function(name, choices) {\n  adist_mat <- adist(name, choices)\n  choices[which.min(adist_mat)]\n}\n```\n(You can expand this for finer control.)\n\n### **B) Use Exported Alternatives**\n\nIf you’re using it for fuzzy matching, the base R function `agrep` (approximate string matching) or the [`stringdist`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringdist) package may be suitable.\n\nExample:\n\n```r\nmatches <- agrep(name, choices, value = TRUE)\n```\n\nOr from `stringdist`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(stringdist)\nclosest <- choices[which.min(stringdist::stringdist(name, choices))]\n```\n\n### **C) Access the Unexported Function (Not Recommended)**\n\nIf for some reason you **must** use dplyr’s actual internal `closest()`, you can access it with:\n\n```r\ngetFromNamespace(\"closest\", \"dplyr\")\n```\n\nBut **this is unstable and brittle**: internal functions can change or be removed **at any time**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach                        | Pros                          | Cons                                     |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Copy/reimplement `closest()`     | Safe, stable, portable        | Minimal code duplication                 |\n| Use base/stringdist alternatives | Safe, possibly more powerful  | Might need reworking your code slightly  |\n| `getFromNamespace()`             | Fastest fix                   | Highly discouraged, brittle, may break   |\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n\n- **Do not rely on dplyr’s internal `closest()`** in package code.\n- **Implement your own equivalent function or use an alternative.**\n- Remove all references to `dplyr::closest()`, since it will always error.\n\n---\n\n### **Action Steps**\n\n1. Remove any calls to `dplyr::closest()`.\n2. Implement your own `closest()` if necessary.\n3. Use explicit alternatives for fuzzy/approximate matching.\n\n**Example own implementation, safe for your package:**\n```r\nclosest <- function(string, choices) {\n    distances <- adist(string, choices)\n    choices[which.min(distances)]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nYou cannot refer to `dplyr::closest()` since it’s not exported. Best practice is to implement your own nearest-match function or use a package designed for fuzzy matching. This will fix your lint and build issues."

                      "text": "Great question! You’ve stumbled on a subtlety of R package development, **dplyr**’s internals, and namespace management.\n\nLet’s summarize and solve:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **`closest()` is not exported by dplyr**\n\n`dplyr` uses `closest()` as a helper function **internally** (e.g. for approximate matching with names), but it is **not part of dplyr’s public API** (see: [dplyr namespace](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/NAMESPACE)). That means:\n\n- You **can** call `closest()` if it’s in your package’s imports or if it’s attached (via `library(dplyr)`).\n- You **cannot** refer to it as `dplyr::closest()` because it’s **not exported**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Why does calling `closest()` work in your package?**\n\nIf your package **Imports:** dplyr, its **namespace will import ALL (even hidden) dplyr functions** for use within your package, unless you restrict imports using `importFrom()` in your NAMESPACE. So, _bare_ `closest()` works **inside your package code**.\n\nHowever, linters or R CMD check will (correctly) warn about:\n- **Non-exported functions**,\n- Namespace pollution,\n- Future incompatibility (internal dplyr function can change or disappear without notice).\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Proper solutions**\n\n### **A) Copy or Reimplement the Function**\n\nIf you rely on `closest()` for basic fuzzy matching or name suggestion, **best practice is to copy/adapt the logic** into your own package. For example:\n\n```r\n#' Find the closest match in a set of choices\nclosest <- function(name, choices) {\n  adist_mat <- adist(name, choices)\n  choices[which.min(adist_mat)]\n}\n```\n(You can expand this for finer control.)\n\n### **B) Use Exported Alternatives**\n\nIf you’re using it for fuzzy matching, the base R function `agrep` (approximate string matching) or the [`stringdist`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringdist) package may be suitable.\n\nExample:\n\n```r\nmatches <- agrep(name, choices, value = TRUE)\n```\n\nOr from `stringdist`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(stringdist)\nclosest <- choices[which.min(stringdist::stringdist(name, choices))]\n```\n\n### **C) Access the Unexported Function (Not Recommended)**\n\nIf for some reason you **must** use dplyr’s actual internal `closest()`, you can access it with:\n\n```r\ngetFromNamespace(\"closest\", \"dplyr\")\n```\n\nBut **this is unstable and brittle**: internal functions can change or be removed **at any time**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach                        | Pros                          | Cons                                     |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Copy/reimplement `closest()`     | Safe, stable, portable        | Minimal code duplication                 |\n| Use base/stringdist alternatives | Safe, possibly more powerful  | Might need reworking your code slightly  |\n| `getFromNamespace()`             | Fastest fix                   | Highly discouraged, brittle, may break   |\n\n---\n\n## **Recommendation**\n\n- **Do not rely on dplyr’s internal `closest()`** in package code.\n- **Implement your own equivalent function or use an alternative.**\n- Remove all references to `dplyr::closest()`, since it will always error.\n\n---\n\n### **Action Steps**\n\n1. Remove any calls to `dplyr::closest()`.\n2. Implement your own `closest()` if necessary.\n3. Use explicit alternatives for fuzzy/approximate matching.\n\n**Example own implementation, safe for your package:**\n```r\nclosest <- function(string, choices) {\n    distances <- adist(string, choices)\n    choices[which.min(distances)]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nYou cannot refer to `dplyr::closest()` since it’s not exported. Best practice is to implement your own nearest-match function or use a package designed for fuzzy matching. This will fix your lint and build issues."

They are subject to change and will break your package.\n\n**There is no `closest()` exported by dplyr**,\nso:\n- Consider: Do you really need `closest`?  \n- Is there another exported dplyr or base R function that does what you want?  \n- If so, use that.\n\n### 2. **If you must use the code**\nIf you really need that functionality:\n\n- **Copy the code** from `dplyr::closest` _into your package_, giving attribution (and respecting dplyr's [MIT License](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).\n- **Rename** it to avoid conflicts.\n\nExample in your package:\n```r\n#' Find index of first closest value greater than or equal to x\n#' Copied from dplyr (MIT licensed), see https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr\nclosest_in_vector <- function(x, table) {\n  match(TRUE, table >= x, nomatch = 0L)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. **Suppress lints (not recommended long-term)**\nYou can suppress lints for the use of such functions, but **this is discouraged** for CRAN-ready packages.\n\n---\n\n## In summary\n\n- `dplyr::closest()` fails because `closest` is **not exported** by dplyr\n- Bare `closest()` works if you import all of dplyr (not recommended; doesn't help users using your pkg outside your dev environment)\n- **Solution:** copy the function into your own package, or use an alternative\n- **Don't depend on non-exported/internal functions from other packages**\n\n---\n\n**Further Reading:**\n- [R Packages: Namespace](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html)\n- [Hadley Wickham on importing functions](https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html#namespace-import)\n\nIf you want help finding a replacement for what `closest()` does, paste the code or explain what you want to do!\n***\n[Criterion]: The user just needs to add `utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")` somewhere in their package and remove the explicit namespacing; `closest()` isn't exported from dplyr but dplyr will use non-standard evaluation on the expression and handle it correctly.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
