    This is where I sometimes write about what Iâ€™m up to related to R, data science, and statistics. My dog, Millie, tags along in the thumbnails. I hope folks find some of these notes useful.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
