I've left a few of them here. :)\n\n![A hand-drawn travel map showing a route through southern Germany and Austria. The map marks Munich (Days 0-3, 7, 8) and a train line to Mittenwald (Days 4 and 5), and Isar-Ursprung Quelle (Day 6), with simple mountain sketches along the border between Germany and Austria.](figures/IMG_8061.png)\n**\n\n## Days 0-3: Munich\n\nThe first days of my visit include lots of biking, coffee, sweet treats, and perusing.\n\n![A view from a bridge at sunset, showing several people sitting on the structure.](figures/IMG_7725.png)\n*The bridge Donnersbergerbrücke overlooks a railyard; the structure of the supports make them a pleasant place to sit and watch the sunset.*\n\n![A top-down view of my friend's kitchen as she's in the process of making bagels.](figures/IMG_7745.png)\n*Johanna, making bagels. I learn that the literal translation for “oven mitts” in German is “hand shoes.”*\n\nI walk into a coffee shop and hear a Chicago rapper, Smino, playing. I learn that staring is not considered impolite here.\n\n![The tan brick facade of a large estate.](figures/IMG_7759.png)\n**\n\n![A green field full of people playing volleyball and lying on blankets.](figures/IMG_7763.png)\n**\n\n\n\n![A typical bike lane in the city; a 2m wide concrete segment is flanked by one side with a cobbled sidewalk, and on the other side with a grassy patch and then the road.](figures/IMG_7790.png)\n*Biking around, no car-dodging necessary.*\n\nAfter I order what the waiter describes as a \"light mixed plate\" and receive nine sausages on a bed of sauerkraut, I resolve to overindex on pretzels for the remainder of the trip.\n\n## Days 4-6: Mittenwald\n\nWoke up feeling anxious about the journey from Munich to Mittenwald. Had an incredible coffee (Roca Junior!) and managed to catch the right trains. From here, I start taking many more pictures.\n\n![A picturesque Alpine village scene with traditional Bavarian houses surrounding a wildflower meadow, while dramatic rocky mountain peaks dominate the background under a blue sky with scattered clouds.](figures/IMG_7878.png)\n**\n\nThe only depictions of Bavaria I've encountered in the U.S. are at theme parks and fairs; as I walked through the town throughout the next few days, I almost expected to see rollercoasters or something.\n\nThe hiking from Mittenwald was absurd. On the first day, I just started walking West of the city into some mountains. On the second, East. On the third, a Friday, my friend Johanna takes off work and drives out to pick me up and cross the border to Austria for another nearby hike.\n\n![An alpine lake framing the same mountain, this time further in the distance.](figures/IMG_7899.png)\n**\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![The main street of Mittenwald with painted Bavarian buildings lining both sides and a small water channel running alongside the road. A brewery umbrella (\"Brauerei Mittenwald\") is visible on the right, while the town's church tower can be seen in the distance.](figures/IMG_7914.png)\n**\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![A view of the village from above; the mountain is slightly to the right of center, and scattered brown and maroon roofs stretch through a valley.](figures/IMG_7911.png)\n**\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![A single-track path meanders along the side of a mountain. A steep rock face covers the right half of the image, while, further in the background to the left, the full height of another peak is shown.](figures/IMG_7954.png)\n**\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![The same mountain shown fully in the previous picture is slightly closer up now, with a wooden crucifix in the foreground.](figures/IMG_7959.png)\n*Lots of these all around Bavaria. It's pretty difficult to see at this resolution, but in the background, a group of soldiers was practicing an alpine rescue operation on the shown cliff face.*\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![A two-story stone building set against a backdrop of rugged mountains. In front of the building are many, empty wooden tables with benches.](figures/IMG_7973.png)\n*Dammkarhütte.*\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![The quaint interior of the hut, with several dining tables, a large wood-burning stove and wood-paneled walls.](figures/IMG_7965.png)\n**\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![The source of the Isar River marked by a wooden sign, where shallow, pristine stream emerges from the wooded hillside with rocks visible through the transparent water.](figures/IMG_8031.png)\n**\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n![The same stream, a few kilometers downstream. The valley in the foreground gives way to yet more dramatic peaks.](figures/IMG_8029.png)\n**\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat evening, we went to my friend’s friend’s birthday party, where everyone was speaking German and the birthday boy was slinging _really_ good pizzas off of his balcony. What a trip.\n\n## Days 7-8: Munich\n\nBiking, coffee, sweet treats, and perusing.\n",
