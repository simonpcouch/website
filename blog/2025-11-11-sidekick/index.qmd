I'm excited to share [`side::kick()`](https://simonpcouch.github.io/side/), an experimental coding agent for RStudio users, built entirely in R. It can interact with your files, talk to your active R session, and run code.

{{< video sidekick.mp4 >}}

`side::kick()` was my best attempt at replicating a Claude Code-like experience with [btw](https://posit-dev.github.io/btw/), [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/), and [shinychat](https://posit-dev.github.io/shinychat/). Beyond what's in those packages, it has a good few bells and whistles:

* **Use any LLM** supported by [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/)--Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and even local models are fair game.
* **See your active R session** to explore your computational environment.
* **Use tools** to read and write files, run shell commands, and read R documentation.
* **Create and execute plans**, allowing it to take on longer-horizon tasks.
* **Persist state** across R sessions so that you can close RStudio and come back to a chat later.
* Respond to **interrupts** so that you can stop execution and reroute the agent.
* Read **skills**, markdown files that describe how to carry out a given task in the way you need it to.

## Getting started

To get started, install with:

```r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/side")
```

Then, run `side::kick()`. You might place `side::kick()` in your `.Rprofile` (perhaps with `usethis::edit_r_profile()`) to launch `side::kick()` every time you start R.

`side::kick()` is intended for use with RStudio's *Sidebar*, a full-height pane that's currently only available in [RStudio Dailies](https://dailies.rstudio.com/). Install RStudio, then search for "Sidebar" in the command palette.

The [introductory vignette](https://simonpcouch.github.io/side/articles/side.html) goes into much more depth on configuring and using the tool!
