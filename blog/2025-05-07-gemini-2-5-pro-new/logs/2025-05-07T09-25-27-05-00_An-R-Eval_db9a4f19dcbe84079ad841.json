You will need dplyr (and purrr if you like the list‐column approach, but you don’t really need it).\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_close_I = {\n      # grab just the Type_I dates\n      dI <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])\n      # if fewer than 2, we cannot have a pair\n      if(length(dI) < 2) {\n        FALSE \n      } else {\n        # any difference of consecutive Type_I dates <= 90 days?\n        # (diff on a Date object comes back as a numeric vector of days)\n        any(diff(dI) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    flag = as.integer(has_typeII | has_close_I)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, flag)\n```\n\nIf you run that on your example data you will get exactly\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID      flag\n  <chr>  <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  `any(type==\"Type_II\")` checks the first criterion.  \n2.  We pull out only the `date`s for which `type==\"Type_I\"`, sort them, and then do `diff()` which gives us the lagged differences in days.  If any of those ≤ 90 we know there is at least one pair of Type_I visits within 90 days.  \n3.  Finally we OR (`|`) those two logicals together and turn it into 0/1 with `as.integer(…)`.  \n\nYou can, of course, also do it in one‐shot in the summarise if you prefer, e.g.:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.integer(\n      any(type==\"Type_II\") |\n      (\n        sum(type==\"Type_I\") >= 2 &&\n        any(diff(sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nEither version will give you your desired `ID`/`flag` table.",
          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion for using `group_by()` and summarize to create a flag indicating whether each ID meets either of the specified conditions.\n\nThe submission provides two solutions:\n\n1. A detailed approach that calculates two separate boolean values:\n   - `has_typeII`: Checks if any record has \"Type_II\"\n   - `has_close_I`: Checks if there are at least two \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n\n2. A more concise \"one-shot\" approach that combines the conditions in a single summarize statement.\n\nComparing to the criterion's solution:\n\n✓ Both the submission and criterion correctly use `group_by(ID)` and `summarize()`\n✓ Both correctly check for \"Type_II\" records using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n✓ Both use the approach of sorting dates and using `diff()` to find Type_I records within 90 days\n✓ Both convert logical results to integers/numerics for the flag\n\nThe submission actually goes beyond the criterion by:\n- Adding an explicit check that there are at least 2 Type_I records before applying `diff()`\n- Providing a more robust implementation that prevents potential errors\n- Offering a more detailed implementation with clearer variable names\n\nThe submission's solutions would produce the correct output as specified in the task.

For the “within 90 days” test you can simply take your Type_I dates, sort them, take diff( ), and see if any of those differences is ≤ 90.\n\nHere is a minimal reproducible example.  You will need dplyr (and purrr if you like the list‐column approach, but you don’t really need it).\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_close_I = {\n      # grab just the Type_I dates\n      dI <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])\n      # if fewer than 2, we cannot have a pair\n      if(length(dI) < 2) {\n        FALSE \n      } else {\n        # any difference of consecutive Type_I dates <= 90 days?\n        # (diff on a Date object comes back as a numeric vector of days)\n        any(diff(dI) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    flag = as.integer(has_typeII | has_close_I)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, flag)\n```\n\nIf you run that on your example data you will get exactly\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID      flag\n  <chr>  <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  `any(type==\"Type_II\")` checks the first criterion.  \n2.  We pull out only the `date`s for which `type==\"Type_I\"`, sort them, and then do `diff()` which gives us the lagged differences in days.  If any of those ≤ 90 we know there is at least one pair of Type_I visits within 90 days.  \n3.  Finally we OR (`|`) those two logicals together and turn it into 0/1 with `as.integer(…)`.  \n\nYou can, of course, also do it in one‐shot in the summarise if you prefer, e.g.:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.integer(\n      any(type==\"Type_II\") |\n      (\n        sum(type==\"Type_I\") >= 2 &&\n        any(diff(sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nEither version will give you your desired `ID`/`flag` table."

For the “within 90 days” test you can simply take your Type_I dates, sort them, take diff( ), and see if any of those differences is ≤ 90.\n\nHere is a minimal reproducible example.  You will need dplyr (and purrr if you like the list‐column approach, but you don’t really need it).\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>% \n  group_by(ID) %>% \n  summarise(\n    has_typeII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    has_close_I = {\n      # grab just the Type_I dates\n      dI <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])\n      # if fewer than 2, we cannot have a pair\n      if(length(dI) < 2) {\n        FALSE \n      } else {\n        # any difference of consecutive Type_I dates <= 90 days?\n        # (diff on a Date object comes back as a numeric vector of days)\n        any(diff(dI) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    flag = as.integer(has_typeII | has_close_I)\n  ) %>% \n  select(ID, flag)\n```\n\nIf you run that on your example data you will get exactly\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID      flag\n  <chr>  <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1.  `any(type==\"Type_II\")` checks the first criterion.  \n2.  We pull out only the `date`s for which `type==\"Type_I\"`, sort them, and then do `diff()` which gives us the lagged differences in days.  If any of those ≤ 90 we know there is at least one pair of Type_I visits within 90 days.  \n3.  Finally we OR (`|`) those two logicals together and turn it into 0/1 with `as.integer(…)`.  \n\nYou can, of course, also do it in one‐shot in the summarise if you prefer, e.g.:\n\n```r\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.integer(\n      any(type==\"Type_II\") |\n      (\n        sum(type==\"Type_I\") >= 2 &&\n        any(diff(sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])) <= 90)\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nEither version will give you your desired `ID`/`flag` table.",

A detailed approach that calculates two separate boolean values:\n   - `has_typeII`: Checks if any record has \"Type_II\"\n   - `has_close_I`: Checks if there are at least two \"Type_I\" records within 90 days of each other\n\n2. A more concise \"one-shot\" approach that combines the conditions in a single summarize statement.\n\nComparing to the criterion's solution:\n\n✓ Both the submission and criterion correctly use `group_by(ID)` and `summarize()`\n✓ Both correctly check for \"Type_II\" records using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n✓ Both use the approach of sorting dates and using `diff()` to find Type_I records within 90 days\n✓ Both convert logical results to integers/numerics for the flag\n\nThe submission actually goes beyond the criterion by:\n- Adding an explicit check that there are at least 2 Type_I records before applying `diff()`\n- Providing a more robust implementation that prevents potential errors\n- Offering a more detailed implementation with clearer variable names\n\nThe submission's solutions would produce the correct output as specified in the task. It uses the tidyverse approach required and properly implements both conditions for setting the flag.\n\nGRADE: C"

You pull off two little tests:\n\n 1.  any “Type_II” at all  \n 2.  any two “Type_I” dates within 90 days  \n\nHere is a minimal working example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.integer(\n      # test 1: any Type_II?\n      any(type == \"Type_II\")\n      |\n      # test 2: any pair of Type_I within 90 days?\n      {\n        ii <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])\n        length(ii) > 1 && any(diff(ii) <= 90)\n      }\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nIf you run that on your toy data you get\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation of the key line:\n\n```r\n{\n  ii <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])    # pull out and sort the Type_I dates\n  length(ii)>1 && any(diff(ii) <= 90) # are there at least two & is any gap ≤ 90?\n}\n```\n\nYou can of course break it up into two smaller pipelines if you find that clearer:\n\n```r\n# 1) detect close Type_I pairs\nclose_I <- df %>%\n  filter(type==\"Type_I\") %>%\n  arrange(ID, date) %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(delta = as.numeric(date - lag(date))) %>%\n  summarise(close_I = any(delta <= 90, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n# 2) detect any Type_II\nhas_II  <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(has_II = any(type==\"Type_II\"))\n\n# 3) join & build flag\nclose_I %>%\n  full_join(has_II, by=\"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(flag = as.integer(close_I | has_II))\n```\n\nEither approach will give you exactly the table you showed."

You pull off two little tests:\n\n 1.  any “Type_II” at all  \n 2.  any two “Type_I” dates within 90 days  \n\nHere is a minimal working example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    flag = as.integer(\n      # test 1: any Type_II?\n      any(type == \"Type_II\")\n      |\n      # test 2: any pair of Type_I within 90 days?\n      {\n        ii <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])\n        length(ii) > 1 && any(diff(ii) <= 90)\n      }\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nIf you run that on your toy data you get\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  ID     flag\n  <chr> <int>\n1 000000     0\n2 000001     1\n3 000002     1\n4 000003     1\n5 000004     1\n6 000005     1\n7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation of the key line:\n\n```r\n{\n  ii <- sort(date[type==\"Type_I\"])    # pull out and sort the Type_I dates\n  length(ii)>1 && any(diff(ii) <= 90) # are there at least two & is any gap ≤ 90?\n}\n```\n\nYou can of course break it up into two smaller pipelines if you find that clearer:\n\n```r\n# 1) detect close Type_I pairs\nclose_I <- df %>%\n  filter(type==\"Type_I\") %>%\n  arrange(ID, date) %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  mutate(delta = as.numeric(date - lag(date))) %>%\n  summarise(close_I = any(delta <= 90, na.rm=TRUE))\n\n# 2) detect any Type_II\nhas_II  <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(has_II = any(type==\"Type_II\"))\n\n# 3) join & build flag\nclose_I %>%\n  full_join(has_II, by=\"ID\") %>%\n  mutate(flag = as.integer(close_I | has_II))\n```\n\nEither approach will give you exactly the table you showed.",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission correctly implements the task according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two key requirements:\n1. Delays should be analyzed by airport (`origin`), not by airplane (`tailnum`), since \"a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK\"\n2. The mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay\n\nLooking at the submitted answer:\n\nThe submission incorrectly groups by `tailnum` (airplane) instead of `origin` (airport):\n```r\nflights %>%\n  # 1) For each plane...\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n```\n\nThis is a fundamental conceptual error. The temporal correlation of delays is happening at the airport level, not at the individual aircraft level. A delayed flight at an airport can cause subsequent flights from that same airport to be delayed, regardless of which aircraft is used.\n\nThe submission also adds complexity by:\n- Using bins for the previous delays rather than working with the raw values\n- Creating a more complex plotting solution than needed\n\nWhile the general approach of using `lag()` to find the previous delay is correct, and the NA handling is appropriate, the core grouping error means this solution doesn't address the actual task as specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Here is one way to do it in the tidyverse.  In this example we\n\n  1. group by each airplane (`tailnum`)  \n  2. sort its flights in time order,  \n  3. create a new column `prev_delay` which is the departure‐delay of the *immediately preceding* flight of *the same plane*,  \n  4. drop the first flight of each plane (where `prev_delay` is `NA`),  \n  5. bin the previous delays into 10‐minute bins,  \n  6. compute the *mean* current departure‐delay for each bin, and  \n  7. plot.  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # 1) For each plane...\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # 2) make sure its flights are in chronological order...\n  arrange(time_hour) %>%\n  # 3) and stick the previous flight's dep_delay into a new column\n  mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # 4) drop all rows where there is no \"previous\" flight\n  filter(!is.na(prev_delay)) %>%\n  # 5) bin the previous delays into nice 10‐minute bins\n  mutate(prev_bin = cut(prev_delay,\n                        breaks = seq(-60, 240, by = 10),\n                        include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%\n  # 6) summarise: for each bin, compute the mean of the *current* dep_delay\n  group_by(prev_bin) %>%\n  summarise(\n    prev_delay_mid = mean(as.numeric(sub(\".*,|\\\\]\", \"\", prev_bin))), \n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  # 7) plot with ggplot2\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_delay_mid, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_line(color = \"steelblue\", size = 1) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Previous flight departure delay (min, mid–bin)\",\n      y = \"Mean current flight departure delay (min)\",\n      title = \"Mean departure delay vs. delay of immediately previous flight (same plane)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n- `group_by(tailnum)`, `arrange(time_hour)` and `mutate(prev_delay = lag(dep_delay))` give each flight the departure‐delay of the *same* plane's prior flight.  \n- We then toss out any rows where `prev_delay` is `NA` (i.e. the very first flight for each plane didn’t have a predecessor),  \n- bin those previous delays into 10-minute intervals with `cut()`,  \n- summarise to compute the mean *current* departure delay in each bin,  \n- and finally draw a simple line‐plot of “mean current delay” against “previous delay.”  \n\nYou can of course adapt the bin‐width, the grouping, or use `stat_summary_bin(… , fun = \"mean\")` directly in your `ggplot` call if you prefer.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Here’s one way to do it.  We\n\n 1. sort each airplane’s flights into chronological order  \n 2. use `lag(dep_delay)` to pull in the previous flight’s delay  \n 3. drop the first flight of each airplane (where `lag` is `NA`)  \n 4. group by the *previous* delay and compute the *mean* of the *current* delay  \n 5. plot mean current‐delay vs. previous‐delay\n\n```r\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # 1) make sure each tail‐number is in time order\n  arrange(tailnum, year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # 2) grab the dep_delay of the immediately preceding flight\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # 3) drop rows where there *isn’t* a previous flight\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # 4) for each previous‐delay value compute the mean of the current delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  # 5) scatterplot + a smoothing curve\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean delay of this flight (minutes)\",\n    title = \"How a flight’s delay depends on the immediately preceding flight\"\n  )\n```\n\nIf you prefer to bin the “previous‐delay” (to reduce noise), you can do something like\n\n```r\n… %>%\n  mutate(prev_delay_bin = cut(prev_dep_delay, breaks = seq(-60, 180, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(prev_delay_bin) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(sub(\"(.*),(.*)]\", \"\\\\1\", prev_delay_bin)),\n             y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_line()\n```\n\nbut the first version already gives you the simple “mean current delay vs. previous delay” plot with `lag()`.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'm evaluating whether the submitted answer correctly addresses the task of visualizing the mean departure delay versus the delay of the immediately preceding flight, specifically with attention to temporal correlation at airports.\n\nKey issues with the submission:\n\n1. **Wrong grouping variable**: The submission groups by `tailnum` (airplane) rather than by `origin` (airport). According to the criterion, we're interested in how delays at one airport affect subsequent flights from the same airport, not how a delay for one airplane affects its next flight.\n\n2. **Incorrect arrangement**: The code arranges by `tailnum` and then time variables, rather than arranging by `origin` and time variables. This means the \"previous flight\" being identified isn't the chronologically previous flight at the same airport.\n\n3. **Otherwise correct implementation**: The submission does properly:\n   - Use `lag()` to get previous delays\n   - Remove NAs or use `na.rm=TRUE`\n   - Group by the lagged delay value when computing means\n   - Create an appropriate visualization\n\nThe submission answers a different question: \"Does a delay in one flight of an airplane affect the next flight of the same airplane?\" rather than \"Does a delay in one flight from an airport affect the next flight from the same airport?\"\n\nSince the code is technically correct but misses a fundamental aspect of the problem (airport-based rather than airplane-based analysis), this is a partially correct answer.\n\nGRADE: P",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

We first put the flights of each airplane (tailnum) in chronological order, compute the previous flight’s delay with `lag()`, drop the missing first‐flights, then for each value of “previous delay” compute the mean of the *current* flight’s `dep_delay` and finally plot:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # order by airplane and flight time\n  arrange(tailnum, year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # capture the previous flight’s departure delay\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # drop the first flight of each plane (no lag)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # for each previous‐delay value compute the mean of the current delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of next flight (minutes)\",\n      title = \"How much does the previous flight’s delay propagate?\"\n    )\n```\n\nExplanation  \n1.  We `arrange()` by `tailnum` and then by date/time so that `lag(dep_delay)` really gives “the delay of the immediately preceding flight of the *same* airplane.”  \n2.  We `filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay))` to drop the first flight of each plane (because it has no predecessor).  \n3.  We `group_by(prev_dep_delay)` and compute the `mean(dep_delay)` of the *current* flight for each value of the previous one.  \n4.  Finally we plot those means versus the binned previous delays, adding a smoothed LOESS curve to make the trend more visible."

                  "text": "Here is one way to do it.  We first put the flights of each airplane (tailnum) in chronological order, compute the previous flight’s delay with `lag()`, drop the missing first‐flights, then for each value of “previous delay” compute the mean of the *current* flight’s `dep_delay` and finally plot:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nflights %>%\n  # order by airplane and flight time\n  arrange(tailnum, year, month, day, hour, minute) %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  # capture the previous flight’s departure delay\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  # drop the first flight of each plane (no lag)\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay)) %>%\n  # for each previous‐delay value compute the mean of the current delay\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Departure delay of previous flight (minutes)\",\n      y = \"Mean departure delay of next flight (minutes)\",\n      title = \"How much does the previous flight’s delay propagate?\"\n    )\n```\n\nExplanation  \n1.  We `arrange()` by `tailnum` and then by date/time so that `lag(dep_delay)` really gives “the delay of the immediately preceding flight of the *same* airplane.”  \n2.  We `filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay))` to drop the first flight of each plane (because it has no predecessor).  \n3.  We `group_by(prev_dep_delay)` and compute the `mean(dep_delay)` of the *current* flight for each value of the previous one.  \n4.  Finally we plot those means versus the binned previous delays, adding a smoothed LOESS curve to make the trend more visible.",

Manually URL-encoding the address using either:\n   - `utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)`\n   - `curl::curl_escape(address)`\n\n2. Using httr2's built-in URL parameter encoding with `req_url_query()`, which automatically handles all the encoding\n\nBoth solutions directly satisfy the criterion.

The second solution uses httr2's built-in functionality which is even more elegant as it handles all the encoding automatically.\n\nThe submission not only fixed the issue but also explained why the error occurs (unsafe characters in URLs) and provided clear, executable code examples for both approaches.

You essentially built a URL that looks like\n\n```\nhttps://geocode.maps.co/search?q=Prince st., New York 10012&api_key=my_secret_api_key\n```\n\nand URLs are not allowed to have literal spaces (or most other punctuation) in them.\n\nThere are two very easy fixes:\n\n1) Manually URL‐encode the address before you glue it into the URL  \n2) Let httr2 do the escaping for you with `req_url_query()`\n\n---\n\n## 1) URL‐encode yourself\n\n```r\nlibrary(glue)\n\naddress  <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key  <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# either with base R\naddress_enc <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\n# or with curl\n# address_enc <- curl::curl_escape(address)\n\nurl <- glue(\n  \"https://geocode.maps.co/search\",\n  \"?q={address_enc}\",\n  \"&api_key={api_key}\"\n)\n\nresp <- httr2::request(url) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform() %>%\n  httr2::resp_body_json()\n```\n\nNow your URL really is\n\n```\nhttps://geocode.maps.co/search?q=Prince%20st.%2C%20New%20York%2010012&api_key=my_secret_api_key\n```\n\nand everything is happy.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Use `req_url_query()`\n\nThis is my personal preference because it keeps your code more declarative and avoids you ever having to think about `%20` vs `+` vs `%2C` etc.\n\n```r\nresp <- httr2::request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  httr2::req_url_query(\n    q       = \"Prince st., New York 10012\",\n    api_key = \"my_secret_api_key\"\n  ) %>%\n  httr2::req_perform() %>%\n  httr2::resp_body_json()\n```\n\nUnder the hood, httr2 will automatically escape the `q` parameter into\n\n```\n?q=Prince%20st.%2C%20New%20York%2010012\n```\n\n—and you never have to do it by hand.\n\n---\n\n### A side note on maps.co\n\nThe free OSM‐based API at https://geocode.maps.co is actually a drop‐in for Nominatim and does *not* require an API key. If you don’t actually need that `api_key` parameter, you can simplify it even further:\n\n```r\nresp <- httr2::request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  httr2::req_url_query(q = \"Prince st., New York 10012\") %>%\n  httr2::req_perform() %>%\n  httr2::resp_body_json()\n```\n\nBut if you’re using some other geocoder that *does* need a key, the same escaping advice still applies.",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submitted answer implements the specific changes listed in the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two exact changes:\n\n1. In the `init` function, change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names when getting discrete breaks.\n\n2. In the `break_info` function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during the mapping process.\n\nThe submitted answer takes a completely different approach. Instead of making these specific changes, it adds a new code block to the `init` function that:\n- Checks if the scale is discrete\n- Checks if the labels are still default (waiver())\n- Checks if breaks are atomic and have names\n- If all conditions are met, transfers the names from breaks to labels and then removes the names from breaks\n\nWhile this approach might work in some scenarios, it doesn't implement the specific changes requested in the criterion. The criterion wants to preserve names throughout the process using `setNames()`, while the submission transfers names to labels early on and then unnames the breaks.\n\nThe submission fundamentally differs from the criterion's requirements, so it doesn't meet the specified criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

In the `break_info` function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names during the mapping process.\n\nThe submitted answer takes a completely different approach. Instead of making these specific changes, it adds a new code block to the `init` function that:\n- Checks if the scale is discrete\n- Checks if the labels are still default (waiver())\n- Checks if breaks are atomic and have names\n- If all conditions are met, transfers the names from breaks to labels and then removes the names from breaks\n\nWhile this approach might work in some scenarios, it doesn't implement the specific changes requested in the criterion. The criterion wants to preserve names throughout the process using `setNames()`, while the submission transfers names to labels early on and then unnames the breaks.\n\nThe submission fundamentally differs from the criterion's requirements, so it doesn't meet the specified criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

All secondary\n#' axes must be based on a one-to-one transformation of the primary axes.\n#'\n#' @param transform A formula or function of a strictly monotonic transformation\n#'\n#' @param trans `r lifecycle::badge(\"deprecated\")`\n#'\n#' @param name The name of the secondary axis\n#'\n#' @param breaks One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no breaks\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default breaks computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A numeric vector of positions\n#'   - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output\n#'\n#' @param labels One of:\n#'   - `NULL` for no labels\n#'   - `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object\n#'   - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)\n#'   - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output\n#'\n#' @param guide A position guide that will be used to render\n#'   the axis on the plot. Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion's specific suggestions for code changes.\n\nThe criterion specifies two clear code changes:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a completely different approach. Instead of preserving names through the `setNames()` function as suggested, it implements a more complex solution that:\n- Detects when breaks have names\n- Checks if the user has already set custom labels\n- Creates a custom function that maps breaks to their names\n\nWhile the submission's approach might work functionally to achieve the same goal (using names of discrete breaks as labels), it does not implement the specific code changes required by the criterion. \n\nThe criterion is very clear about what changes are needed, and the submission uses an entirely different method. The criterion specified simple, direct changes to preserve names during break processing, while the submission modifies the label generation logic.\n\nGRADE: I",

Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a completely different approach.

Essentially what we do is, in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, *after* we have computed the discrete breaks, but *before* falling back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels, we check:\n\n  •  Are we on a discrete scale?  \n  •  Are the user‐supplied `labels` still a `waiver()`?  \n  •  Does our breaks vector have names?  \n\nIf so, we copy those names into `self$labels`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n\n-    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n+    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n\n+    #\n+    # If discrete, compute breaks and then—*before* we inherit\n+    # labels from the primary axis—see if the breaks have names.\n+    # If so, use them as our labels.\n+    #\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # compute the actual break values\n+      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+\n+      # if labels still at the waiver() and our breaks are named,\n+      # use those names\n+      if (is.waiver(self$labels)\n+          && is.atomic(self$breaks)\n+          && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n+        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+      } else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        # fallback to inheriting the primary axis's labels\n+        self$labels <- scale$labels\n+      }\n+\n+      # and inherit the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # once we've done the discrete case, we can stop here\n+      return()\n+    }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n@@\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\nExplanation of the key lines:\n\n1.  We detect discrete scales with `if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }`.  \n2.  We force evaluation of the breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  \n3.  If the user did not supply any labels (`is.waiver(self$labels)`) *and* those breaks carry names, we steal those names for our secondary axis labels.  \n4.  Otherwise (if the user asked for `derive()` or already provided labels) we fall back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels or to whatever the user provided.  \n5.  We inherit the `guide` the same way we do in the continuous case.  \n6.  We `return()` so that the rest of the continuous‐axis initialization is skipped when the scale is discrete.  \n\nWith that in place, the following will now pull in your break names by default:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = letters[1:5], y = 1:5)\n# name the breaks\nbr <- setNames(1:5, paste0(\"B\", 1:5))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., breaks = br))\n# i.e. the secondary axis will now show \"B1\", \"B2\", … as labels\n```\n\nFeel free to tweak the exact placement of this block, or to add helper tests (e.g. that `self$breaks` is not a function) depending on how defensive you want to be.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Essentially what we do is, in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, *after* we have computed the discrete breaks, but *before* falling back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels, we check:\n\n  •  Are we on a discrete scale?  \n  •  Are the user‐supplied `labels` still a `waiver()`?  \n  •  Does our breaks vector have names?  \n\nIf so, we copy those names into `self$labels`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n\n-    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n+    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n\n+    #\n+    # If discrete, compute breaks and then—*before* we inherit\n+    # labels from the primary axis—see if the breaks have names.\n+    # If so, use them as our labels.\n+    #\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # compute the actual break values\n+      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+\n+      # if labels still at the waiver() and our breaks are named,\n+      # use those names\n+      if (is.waiver(self$labels)\n+          && is.atomic(self$breaks)\n+          && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n+        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+      } else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        # fallback to inheriting the primary axis's labels\n+        self$labels <- scale$labels\n+      }\n+\n+      # and inherit the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # once we've done the discrete case, we can stop here\n+      return()\n+    }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n@@\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\nExplanation of the key lines:\n\n1.  We detect discrete scales with `if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }`.  \n2.  We force evaluation of the breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  \n3.  If the user did not supply any labels (`is.waiver(self$labels)`) *and* those breaks carry names, we steal those names for our secondary axis labels.  \n4.  Otherwise (if the user asked for `derive()` or already provided labels) we fall back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels or to whatever the user provided.  \n5.  We inherit the `guide` the same way we do in the continuous case.  \n6.  We `return()` so that the rest of the continuous‐axis initialization is skipped when the scale is discrete.  \n\nWith that in place, the following will now pull in your break names by default:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = letters[1:5], y = 1:5)\n# name the breaks\nbr <- setNames(1:5, paste0(\"B\", 1:5))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., breaks = br))\n# i.e. the secondary axis will now show \"B1\", \"B2\", … as labels\n```\n\nFeel free to tweak the exact placement of this block, or to add helper tests (e.g. that `self$breaks` is not a function) depending on how defensive you want to be.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the specific criterion for editing the code to use named discrete breaks as labels by default.\n\nThe criterion specifies two exact code changes:\n\n1. In the first part, change:\n```\nif (scale$is_discrete()) {\n  self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n}\n```\nto:\n```\nif (scale$is_discrete()) {\n  self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n}\n```\n\n2. In the second part, change:\n```\nelse {\n  breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n}\n```\nto:\n```\nelse {\n  breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the submission takes a completely different approach. Instead of these specific edits, it adds a larger block of code to explicitly check if:\n- The scale is discrete\n- The labels are using waiver()\n- The breaks have names\n\nIf those conditions are met, it manually copies the names from breaks to labels.\n\nWhile the submission aims to solve the same problem (using named breaks as labels for discrete scales), it does not make the specific code changes required by the criterion. The submission's solution might work functionally, but it doesn't match the requested implementation.\n\nGRADE: P",

Essentially what we do is, in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, *after* we have computed the discrete breaks, but *before* falling back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels, we check:\n\n  •  Are we on a discrete scale?  \n  •  Are the user‐supplied `labels` still a `waiver()`?  \n  •  Does our breaks vector have names?  \n\nIf so, we copy those names into `self$labels`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n\n-    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n+    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n\n+    #\n+    # If discrete, compute breaks and then—*before* we inherit\n+    # labels from the primary axis—see if the breaks have names.\n+    # If so, use them as our labels.\n+    #\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # compute the actual break values\n+      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+\n+      # if labels still at the waiver() and our breaks are named,\n+      # use those names\n+      if (is.waiver(self$labels)\n+          && is.atomic(self$breaks)\n+          && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n+        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+      } else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        # fallback to inheriting the primary axis's labels\n+        self$labels <- scale$labels\n+      }\n+\n+      # and inherit the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # once we've done the discrete case, we can stop here\n+      return()\n+    }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n@@\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\nExplanation of the key lines:\n\n1.  We detect discrete scales with `if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }`.  \n2.  We force evaluation of the breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  \n3.  If the user did not supply any labels (`is.waiver(self$labels)`) *and* those breaks carry names, we steal those names for our secondary axis labels.  \n4.  Otherwise (if the user asked for `derive()` or already provided labels) we fall back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels or to whatever the user provided.  \n5.  We inherit the `guide` the same way we do in the continuous case.  \n6.  We `return()` so that the rest of the continuous‐axis initialization is skipped when the scale is discrete.  \n\nWith that in place, the following will now pull in your break names by default:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = letters[1:5], y = 1:5)\n# name the breaks\nbr <- setNames(1:5, paste0(\"B\", 1:5))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., breaks = br))\n# i.e. the secondary axis will now show \"B1\", \"B2\", … as labels\n```\n\nFeel free to tweak the exact placement of this block, or to add helper tests (e.g. that `self$breaks` is not a function) depending on how defensive you want to be."

Essentially what we do is, in the `AxisSecondary$init()` method, *after* we have computed the discrete breaks, but *before* falling back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels, we check:\n\n  •  Are we on a discrete scale?  \n  •  Are the user‐supplied `labels` still a `waiver()`?  \n  •  Does our breaks vector have names?  \n\nIf so, we copy those names into `self$labels`.\n\n```diff\n--- a/R/axis-secondary.R\n+++ b/R/axis-secondary.R\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) self$name <- scale$name\n\n-    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n+    if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n\n+    #\n+    # If discrete, compute breaks and then—*before* we inherit\n+    # labels from the primary axis—see if the breaks have names.\n+    # If so, use them as our labels.\n+    #\n+    if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n+      # compute the actual break values\n+      self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n+\n+      # if labels still at the waiver() and our breaks are named,\n+      # use those names\n+      if (is.waiver(self$labels)\n+          && is.atomic(self$breaks)\n+          && !is.null(names(self$breaks))) {\n+        self$labels <- names(self$breaks)\n+      } else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+        # fallback to inheriting the primary axis's labels\n+        self$labels <- scale$labels\n+      }\n+\n+      # and inherit the guide if requested\n+      if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n+        self$guide <- scale$guide\n+      }\n+\n+      # once we've done the discrete case, we can stop here\n+      return()\n+    }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n@@\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) self$labels <- scale$labels\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) self$guide <- scale$guide\n   },\n```\n\nExplanation of the key lines:\n\n1.  We detect discrete scales with `if (scale$is_discrete()) { … }`.  \n2.  We force evaluation of the breaks via `scale$get_breaks()`.  \n3.  If the user did not supply any labels (`is.waiver(self$labels)`) *and* those breaks carry names, we steal those names for our secondary axis labels.  \n4.  Otherwise (if the user asked for `derive()` or already provided labels) we fall back to inheriting the primary axis’s labels or to whatever the user provided.  \n5.  We inherit the `guide` the same way we do in the continuous case.  \n6.  We `return()` so that the rest of the continuous‐axis initialization is skipped when the scale is discrete.  \n\nWith that in place, the following will now pull in your break names by default:\n\n```r\ndf <- data.frame(x = letters[1:5], y = 1:5)\n# name the breaks\nbr <- setNames(1:5, paste0(\"B\", 1:5))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., breaks = br))\n# i.e. the secondary axis will now show \"B1\", \"B2\", … as labels\n```\n\nFeel free to tweak the exact placement of this block, or to add helper tests (e.g. that `self$breaks` is not a function) depending on how defensive you want to be.",

It\n\n 1. drops any flights without a tail‐number  \n 2. groups by tailnum  \n 3. counts total flights and missing arrivals  \n 4. keeps only those with ≥100 flights  \n 5. computes the missing‐arrival proportion  \n 6. sorts descending and pulls off the top tailnum  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%             # drop flights with no tail number\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%                   \n  summarise(\n    n_flights    = n(),                   # total # of flights\n    n_missing    = sum(is.na(arr_delay)), # # flights with missing arr_delay\n    prop_missing = n_missing / n_flights  # proportion missing\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%            # require at least 100 flights\n  arrange(desc(prop_missing)) %>%         # sort by highest missing rate\n  slice(1) %>%                            # take the top tailnum\n  pull(tailnum)                           # return just the tailnum\n```\n\nIf you also want to see the proportion and counts, drop the final `pull()`:\n\n```r\n… %>%\nslice(1)\n# # A tibble: 1 × 4\n#   tailnum n_flights n_missing prop_missing\n#   <chr>       <int>     <int>        <dbl>\n# 1 XXXX          123        45        0.366\n```\n\nThis tells you which `tailnum` (among those with ≥100 flights) has the highest fraction of `NA` arrivals.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for finding the tailnum with the highest proportion of NA arr_delays that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion specifies three main steps:\n1) Group by tailnum and filter for those with > 100 flights\n2) Calculate proportion of NA arr_delay values using mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n3) Arrange in descending order of this proportion\n\nLet's examine the submission:\n\nThe submission takes a slightly different approach but accomplishes the same goal:\n- It filters out NA tailnums (which the criterion notes is acceptable)\n- It groups by tailnum\n- It calculates counts and proportions using:\n  ```r\n  n_flights = n()\n  n_missing = sum(is.na(arr_delay))\n  prop_missing = n_missing / n_flights\n  ```\n- It filters for tailnums with at least 100 flights\n- It arranges by prop_missing in descending order\n- It extracts just the top result\n\nWhile the submission calculates the proportion using sum(is.na(arr_delay))/n() rather than mean(is.na(arr_delay)), these are mathematically equivalent. The mean of boolean values is the same as the sum divided by count.\n\nThe submission also includes additional steps (slice(1) and pull(tailnum)) to specifically return only the requested tailnum, which is appropriate given the original question.\n\nThe code correctly implements all the required steps and would produce the correct answer, even though the specific approach differs slightly from the example in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

Instead, it performs a summarization first and then filters on `total_flights >= 100`. The criterion specifies filtering with `n() > 100` within groups before summarization.\n\n2. **Calculating proportion of NAs**: The submission uses `sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / total_flights` rather than `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`. While these are mathematically equivalent, it doesn't follow the exact approach in the criterion.\n\n3. **Arranging results**: Instead of using `arrange(desc())` as specified, the submission uses `slice_max(prop_missing, n = 1)`. This achieves the same result but uses a different function.\n\nThe submission correctly filters out NA tailnums and will produce the correct result, but it doesn't follow the specific approach outlined in the criterion. The solution is valid and efficient, but it takes a different path than what was specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: P",

So mutate thinks\n\n```r\nby = c(id,date)\n```\n\nis a new column (and since you’ve c()-d your two length‐n vectors together it is length 2*n, hence the complaint).\n\nYou have two simple fixes:\n\n1) Use the old school group_by()/ungroup() approach:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(id, date) %>%\n  mutate(\n    some_new_col = …        # your computation\n  ) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\n2) Or, if you’re on dplyr ≥ 1.1.0, use the new “.by” argument inside mutate() (no group_by needed):\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf %>%\n  mutate(\n    .by          = c(id, date),\n    some_new_col = …        # your computation\n  )\n```\n\nEither of those will group your data by id and date before doing the mutate.

Moving the name parameter logic inside the function body using `substitute()` and `missing()`\n2. Re-substituting inside the function body\n3.

The usual pattern in base‐R is to grab the symbol _inside_ the body of the function, e.g.:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset,\n                        name,\n                        dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  \n  ## capture the _expression_ that the user passed to `dataset`\n  dataset_expr <- substitute(dataset)\n  \n  ## if they didn't supply a name, deparse that symbol\n  if (missing(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(dataset_expr)\n  }\n  \n  ## now `dataset` is your actual tibble/data.frame,\n  ## and `name` is either what the user passed\n  ## or the string of the symbol\n  message(\"I will create a task called: \", name)\n  \n  ## … the rest of your code …\n}\n\n## -------------------------------------------------\n## TEST\nsimple_addition <- tibble::tibble(\n  input  = c(\"What's 2+2?\",  \"What's 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\",           \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk <- task_create(simple_addition)\n#> I will create a task called: simple_addition\n```\n\nIf you’d rather keep the default in the signature, you can still do it, but you have to be careful that you _re_–substitute inside the body:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset,\n                        name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n                        dir  = eval_log_dir()) {\n  ## make sure we pick up the _unevaluated_ dataset\n  ## not its value if it was already forced\n  real_name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  if (!missing(name)) real_name <- name\n\n  message(\"I will create a task called: \", real_name)\n  ## …\n}\n```\n\nFinally, if you’re happy to lean on **rlang**, you can write\n\n```r\nlibrary(rlang)\n\ntask_create <- function(dataset,\n                        name = as_name(enquo(dataset)),\n                        dir  = eval_log_dir()) {\n  message(\"I will create a task called: \", name)\n  ## …\n}\n```\n\nAll of these patterns will give you `\"simple_addition\"` rather than a giant printed `structure(...)` call.",

By pulling the `deparse(substitute(…))` into the body and guarding it with `if (missing(name))` you guarantee that:\n\n1. If the user explicitly passes `name=` you use what they gave you.  \n2. If they don’t, you grab the literal R symbol they passed in as `dataset`, turn it into a string, and use that.  \n\n---\n\nIf you’d rather stay in the tidyverse/rlang world you can do something very similar with `ensym()`/`as_name()`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(rlang)\n\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name = ensym(dataset),\n  dir  = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n  name <- as_name(name)\n  ## …the rest …\n}\n```\n\nBut in base R the `missing(name)` + `deparse(substitute(dataset))` idiom is by far the simplest."

This namespace mismatch is why the dynamically generated UI elements (verbatimTextOutput and plotOutput) aren't rendering\n2. The solution is to use `session$ns` instead of creating a new namespace with `NS(id)`\n3. This change ensures the dynamically generated UI elements get the exact namespace Shiny expects\n\nThe explanation aligns perfectly with the criterion, which states that the issue is about `NS(id)` not maintaining correct hierarchical relationships with parent modules, while `session$ns` ensures properly-qualified namespaces.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies where to make the change in the code:\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns         # ← use THIS ns instead of NS(id)\n```\n\nThe submission fully meets the criterion by correctly diagnosing the problem and providing the appropriate solution.\n\nGRADE: C",

As a result your dynamically generated UI is asking Shiny to draw two outputs with the wrong ids, so they never get bound.\n\nYou have two choices:\n\n 1.  Don’t namespace the bits inside your `renderUI()` at all.  Shiny will automatically namespace any UI you emit from a module.\n\n 2.  If you really want to namespace yourself, use the `session$ns` function (not `NS(id)`).\n\nHere is the minimal change to your `innerServer()` that will make it work.  I have simply removed the `NS(id)` and either\n\n  * rendered the sub-UI un-namespaced (Shiny will namespace it automatically), or  \n  * used `session$ns(...)` (which pulls in the full “outer1-inner1” prefix).\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # First output that lives outside the generated UI\n    output$someText <- renderText(\"something\")\n\n    # The bits we will insert inside renderUI\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText(\"something Generated\")\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      df <- data.frame(x=sample(1:25,25), y=sample(1:25,25))\n      ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"The title\")\n    })\n\n    # Now render the UI.  Shiny will automatically namespace the verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\")\n    # and plotOutput(\"theChart\") for us because we are inside a module.\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(\"someTextGenerated\"),\n        plotOutput(\"theChart\")\n      )\n    })\n\n    # -- alternatively, if you really want to see the explicit ns() --\n    # output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n    #   ns <- session$ns\n    #   tagList(\n    #     h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n    #     verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n    #     plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n    #   )\n    # })\n\n  })\n}\n```\n\nAnd your `inner_UI()` stays exactly the same:\n\n```r\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNow everything will line up:\n\n  * `uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\"))` will create a div for `outer1-inner1-theGeneratedUI`.\n  * your `renderUI()` will populate that div with two new outputs,\n    - one named `outer1-inner1-someTextGenerated`,  \n    - and one named `outer1-inner1-theChart`.  \n\nBecause you either left them un-namespaced or used `session$ns()`, Shiny can find them and render them."

The submission shows the precise code change needed:\n\nFrom:\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- NS(id)\n```\n\nTo:\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n```\n\nThe explanation is thorough and correctly addresses the namespace issue described in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

That means pak only ever looks on CRAN (or other R repositories) for “spatialstuff”, never on GitHub, and so your org/spatial-Stuff repo is never fetched.\n\nIn short: it isn’t a typo or case–sensitivity mistake on your side, it’s just a gap in pak’s dependency resolution.  pak knows how to install CRAN packages; it doesn’t yet read Remotes and pull GitHub packages.\n\nYou have two ways around it:\n\n1) Switch your pkgdown workflow back to remotes::install_deps() instead of pak.  \n   The old template ran something like:\n   \n     - name: Install dependencies\n       run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'\n   \n   remotes::install_deps *will* read your Remotes field and install org/spatial-Stuff before building the site.\n\n2) Explicitly install your GitHub dependency before pak runs.  Something like this in your GitHub action:\n   \n     - name: Install spatial-Stuff from GitHub\n       run: |\n         Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n     - name: Build pkgdown site\n       run: |\n         Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install_deps()'\n         Rscript -e 'pkgdown::build_site()'\n   \nEither approach will ensure spatialstuff is sitting in your library by the time pkgdown tries to build.  \n\nRight now it’s not “user error” in the sense of a misspelt package name – it’s just pak not handling Remotes.  Once pak adds support for GitHub remotes (tracked in r-lib/pak#…), you’ll be able to go back to the one–liner “pak::pkg_install_deps()” and have it Just Work."

That means pak only ever looks on CRAN (or other R repositories) for “spatialstuff”, never on GitHub, and so your org/spatial-Stuff repo is never fetched.\n\nIn short: it isn’t a typo or case–sensitivity mistake on your side, it’s just a gap in pak’s dependency resolution.  pak knows how to install CRAN packages; it doesn’t yet read Remotes and pull GitHub packages.\n\nYou have two ways around it:\n\n1) Switch your pkgdown workflow back to remotes::install_deps() instead of pak.  \n   The old template ran something like:\n   \n     - name: Install dependencies\n       run: Rscript -e 'remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'\n   \n   remotes::install_deps *will* read your Remotes field and install org/spatial-Stuff before building the site.\n\n2) Explicitly install your GitHub dependency before pak runs.  Something like this in your GitHub action:\n   \n     - name: Install spatial-Stuff from GitHub\n       run: |\n         Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"org/spatial-Stuff\")'\n     - name: Build pkgdown site\n       run: |\n         Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install_deps()'\n         Rscript -e 'pkgdown::build_site()'\n   \nEither approach will ensure spatialstuff is sitting in your library by the time pkgdown tries to build.  \n\nRight now it’s not “user error” in the sense of a misspelt package name – it’s just pak not handling Remotes.  Once pak adds support for GitHub remotes (tracked in r-lib/pak#…), you’ll be able to go back to the one–liner “pak::pkg_install_deps()” and have it Just Work.",

                  "text": "In R6 there are two different “locks” going on:\n\n 1.  lock_objects (the one you set to FALSE) only controls whether the *instance* gets locked *after* initialize() returns; it does *not* stop R6 from locking the bindings that came from the class definition before initialize() runs.\n\n 2.  Every method you put in the public list (or inherit from a parent class) is “baked in” to the environment of the instance *before* initialize() and those bindings are locked.  You cannot re-assign to them in initialize() unless you explicitly tell R6 not to lock them in the first place.\n\nThere are three straightforward ways to fix your example:\n\n1) Don’t generate foo in initialize — declare it in Parent’s public list.\n\n   ```r\n   Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n     \"Parent\",\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         print(\"foo\")\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child <- R6::R6Class(\n     \"Child\",\n     inherit = Parent,\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         super$foo()\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child$new()$foo()\n   #> [1] \"foo\"\n   ```\n\n2) If you really must build foo dynamically then give yourself an *unlocked* slot by declaring a placeholder in the public list and then filling it in initialize:\n\n   ```r\n   Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n     \"Parent\",\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       foo = NULL,        # placeholder\n       initialize = function() {\n         self$foo <- function() {\n           print(\"foo\")\n         }\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child <- R6::R6Class(\n     \"Child\",\n     inherit = Parent,\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         super$foo()\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child$new()$foo()\n   #> [1] \"foo\"\n   ```\n\n3) (R6 ≥ 2.5.0) turn off the *class-level* locking with the new `lock_class` flag.  This will prevent R6 from locking up your foo binding *before* initialize():\n\n   ```r\n   Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n     \"Parent\",\n     lock_class   = FALSE,\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       initialize = function() {\n         self$foo <- function() {\n           print(\"foo\")\n         }\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child <- R6::R6Class(\n     \"Child\",\n     inherit      = Parent,\n     lock_class   = FALSE,\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         super$foo()\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child$new()$foo()\n   #> [1] \"foo\"\n   ```\n\n— but in almost every case the **simplest** idiom is (1): if you know the parent has a foo, just put it in the public list of Parent, then override in the child.",

The trick is simply to put a dummy `foo = NULL` into the parent’s public list:\n\n     Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n       \"Parent\",\n       lock_objects = FALSE,\n       public = list(\n         foo = NULL,              # ← declare the name first\n         initialize = function() {\n           # now this assignment will succeed\n           self$foo <- function() {\n             cat(\"foo\\n\")\n           }\n         }\n       )\n     )\n     \n     Child <- R6::R6Class(\n       \"Child\",\n       inherit     = Parent,\n       lock_objects = FALSE,\n       public      = list(\n         foo = function() {\n           super$foo()\n         }\n       )\n     )\n     \n     c <- Child$new()\n     c$foo()\n     #> foo\n\nWhat happened here is\n\n- By putting `foo = NULL` in the parent’s public list, R6 creates an _unlocked_ binding called `foo` in every new object.\n- When `initialize()` runs and does `self$foo <- …` it is simply _changing_ that unlocked binding and succeeds.\n- In the child class you get to override `foo` statically (and lock or not lock it according to `lock_objects = FALSE`), and your call to `super$foo()` goes to the dynamically generated parent implementation.\n\nIf you leave `foo` out of the parent’s public list, then the first time you mention `foo` in the child you create & lock it, and you will _never_ be permitted to overwrite it at runtime.  Hence the “cannot change value of locked binding for 'foo'” error.\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to determine if the submission meets the criterion of using `unlockBinding()` to solve the problem.\n\nLooking at the submitted answer, the author provides two different approaches to solve the issue:\n1. Avoiding name collisions by using different method names or private variables\n2. Pre-declaring a binding in the parent class with `foo = NULL` to create an unlocked binding that can be modified later\n\nHowever, neither of these solutions utilizes the `unlockBinding()` function as specified in the criterion. The criterion explicitly states that the solution should use:\n\n```r\ninitialize = function() {\n  unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n  self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n    print('foo')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhile the submission provides detailed explanations and working alternatives that address the underlying problem, it does not meet the specific criterion of using `unlockBinding()` to modify the locked binding.

That means that as soon as “foo” exists in the child object’s environment (because you declared it in `public = list(foo = …)`), you can’t go back in `initialize()` and overwrite it – you’ll get exactly the error you saw.\n\nYou have basically three ways out of this:\n\n 1.  Don’t create `foo` dynamically in the parent.  Declare it in the parent’s `public` list:\n\n    ```r\n    Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Parent\",\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        foo = function() {\n          # default behaviour\n          print(\"foo from Parent\")\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Child\",\n      inherit  = Parent,\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        foo = function() {\n          super$foo()\n          cat(\"and then Child does its thing\\n\")\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child$new()$foo()\n    #> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n    #> and then Child does its thing\n    ```\n\n 2.  If you really must create `foo` in `Parent$initialize()`, only do so when the child hasn’t already supplied it.  e.g.\n\n    ```r\n    Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Parent\",\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        initialize = function() {\n          if (!\"foo\" %in% names(self)) {\n            self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n              print(\"foo from Parent\")\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Child\",\n      inherit = Parent,\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        foo = function() {\n          super$foo()\n          cat(\"and then Child does its thing\\n\")\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child$new()$foo()\n    #> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n    #> and then Child does its thing\n    ```\n\n 3.  You can even, if you really wanted, unlock the “foo” binding on the fly, overwrite it, and then re-lock it – but that is generally a bit ugly and error-prone:\n\n    ```r\n    Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Parent\",\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        initialize = function() {\n          if (bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n            unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n            on.exit(lockBinding(\"foo\", self), add = TRUE)\n          }\n          self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n            print(\"foo from Parent\")\n          }\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    # … same Child as above …\n    ```\n\nIn almost every case the cleanest thing is option 1: define your methods at class-creation time (rather than inside `initialize()`).  That way R6’s normal inheritance model works for you automatically."

That means that as soon as “foo” exists in the child object’s environment (because you declared it in `public = list(foo = …)`), you can’t go back in `initialize()` and overwrite it – you’ll get exactly the error you saw.\n\nYou have basically three ways out of this:\n\n 1.  Don’t create `foo` dynamically in the parent.  Declare it in the parent’s `public` list:\n\n    ```r\n    Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Parent\",\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        foo = function() {\n          # default behaviour\n          print(\"foo from Parent\")\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Child\",\n      inherit  = Parent,\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        foo = function() {\n          super$foo()\n          cat(\"and then Child does its thing\\n\")\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child$new()$foo()\n    #> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n    #> and then Child does its thing\n    ```\n\n 2.  If you really must create `foo` in `Parent$initialize()`, only do so when the child hasn’t already supplied it.  e.g.\n\n    ```r\n    Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Parent\",\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        initialize = function() {\n          if (!\"foo\" %in% names(self)) {\n            self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n              print(\"foo from Parent\")\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Child\",\n      inherit = Parent,\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        foo = function() {\n          super$foo()\n          cat(\"and then Child does its thing\\n\")\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    \n    Child$new()$foo()\n    #> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n    #> and then Child does its thing\n    ```\n\n 3.  You can even, if you really wanted, unlock the “foo” binding on the fly, overwrite it, and then re-lock it – but that is generally a bit ugly and error-prone:\n\n    ```r\n    Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n      \"Parent\",\n      lock_objects = FALSE,\n      public = list(\n        initialize = function() {\n          if (bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n            unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n            on.exit(lockBinding(\"foo\", self), add = TRUE)\n          }\n          self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n            print(\"foo from Parent\")\n          }\n        }\n      )\n    )\n    # … same Child as above …\n    ```\n\nIn almost every case the cleanest thing is option 1: define your methods at class-creation time (rather than inside `initialize()`).  That way R6’s normal inheritance model works for you automatically."

What is happening is\n\n  1. your outer function has a default `chat = ellmer::chat_claude()`,  \n  2. the inner function then does `chat = chat` again, which on the first call still hasn’t forced the outer promise,  \n  3. so R gets into a tangled promise recursion and bails with  \n\n     “promise already under evaluation: recursive default argument reference or earlier problems?”\n\nThe cure is simply to *force* the outer `chat` into a real object (or capture it under a fresh name) before you return the inner function.  Once `chat` is a real object, your inner default `chat = chat` is no longer a promise-to-a-promise and the error disappears.  For example, either\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)      ## <— forces the promise\n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch  <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor equivalently\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  chat0 <- chat   ## capture/evaluate it now\n  function(input, chat = chat0) {\n    ch  <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor, if you don’t really need the inner `chat=` argument at all, you can just close over the already evaluated `chat`:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)\n  function(input) {\n    ch  <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny of these will eliminate the recursive‐promise error.\n***\n[Criterion]: It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Must use `cli::cli_abort()`\n2. No `paste0()` calls in the solution\n3. Should attempt to pluralize using the {?} syntax\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n✓ It correctly uses `cli::cli_abort()` as the main function\n✓ It completely eliminates all `paste0()` calls\n✓ It properly uses the {?} syntax for pluralization with `argument{?s}` and `object{?s}`\n\nThe submission actually provides two options, both of which fulfill the requirements. The first option uses `{are/is}` for the verb while the second uses a conditional expression for the same purpose. Both approaches are valid in cli syntax.\n\nThe submission also smartly uses `cli::oxford()` to handle the comma-separated list with proper quoting, which is an elegant way to handle the list formatting.\n\nThe pluralization approach differs slightly from the example in the criterion (which uses `{?is/are}` and `{a/some}`), but the submission's approach is fully valid and arguably more comprehensive since it handles both noun pluralization and verb agreement.\n\nGRADE: C"

          "explanation": "I need to determine if the submission meets the criterion regarding the correct solution for fixing the Shiny app error.\n\nThe criterion identifies the problem as having only `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function, without the actual rendering code. The solution according to the criterion is to move both the output definition and its rendering code into a proper server function.\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\n1. It correctly identifies the root cause: \"you never actually *define* `output$plot` inside your server function – you only reference it\"\n\n2. It provides the right solution: \"move your `renderPlot` (and any other reactives that depend on `input`) *into* the body of the server function\"\n\n3. The submission's code example properly implements this fix by:\n   - Creating a proper named server function\n   - Moving all the reactive expressions inside that function\n   - Moving the output$plot renderPlot code inside the server function\n   - Fixing the shinyApp call to use the proper server function\n\nAlthough the submission provides additional improvements beyond what was strictly required (like using req() instead of validate() in some places, adding a title to the plot, and restructuring some of the code), the core fix that directly addresses the criterion is clearly implemented.\n\nThe submission correctly solves the exact problem specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly identifies and addresses the issue with the Shiny app code according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies that the problem is about having `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function, and the solution is to move the `output$plot` definition and rendering code into a proper server function.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Identifies the root cause of the error - defining `output$plot` in the global environment and then not properly using it in the server function passed to `shinyApp()`\n2. Explains that the server function currently does nothing but reference `output$plot` without actually defining it\n3. Provides a complete solution that involves moving all the reactive expressions and rendering code inside a proper server function\n4. Shows detailed code examples for implementing the solution\n5. Explains why the error occurs (\"Can't read output 'plot'\")\n\nThe submission actually goes beyond the criterion by offering two alternative approaches and providing a more detailed explanation of the Shiny app architecture. It emphasizes the importance of having all input/output references inside the server function, which is a key concept in Shiny.\n\nThe solution in the submission is consistent with the one specified in the criterion, with some additional improvements and explanations.\n\nGRADE: C",

You have defined\n\n```r\noutput$plot <- renderPlot({ … })\n```\n\nin the global environment, and then you immediately throw it away by giving `shinyApp()` an anonymous server function that does nothing but reference `output$plot` (and so the actual `output$plot` never makes it into the running server).  Hence Shiny tells you it “can’t read output ‘plot’.”\n\nThere are two very simple ways to fix this:\n\n1) Move _all_ of your input‐dependent code (the `reactive({})`s and the `renderPlot`) _inside_ your server function, and then pass that server function to `shinyApp()`.  For example,\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  # load & clean your data once\n  Kidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n    as.data.frame() %>%\n    mutate(\n      CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n    )\n  \n  # reactives\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)   # shorthand for validate+need\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE    == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT  >  input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n  \n  # render the plot\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(VISIT_COUNT, Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nNote the important bits:\n\n  • Everything that refers to `input$…` or `output$…` must live inside your `server <- function(input, output, session) { … }`.  \n  • You then hand _that_ server function to `shinyApp(ui, server)`.  \n\n2) If you really want to keep your reactive definitions up at the top of the file, you can do that, but you still have to _assign_ the actual `renderPlot` _inside_ the server you pass to `shinyApp()`.  So at the very minimum you have to do\n\n```r\nshinyApp(\n  ui = ui,\n  server = function(input, output, session) {\n    output$plot <- renderPlot({ \n      # use your global filtered_data() here\n      …\n    })\n  }\n)\n```\n\nbut that is more confusing than just migrating all of the `reactive()` and `renderPlot()` calls into your server function as in (1).\n\n---\n\nIn short:\n\n  1. Don’t define `output$plot` in the global scope and then hand Shiny a server that never assigns it.  \n  2. Move your `reactive()`s and `renderPlot()` into a single `server <- function(input, output, session) { … }`.  \n  3. Call `shinyApp(ui, server)`.\n\nOnce you do that, Shiny will find `output$plot` on startup, and the “Can’t read output ‘plot’” error will go away.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function.

Everything that depends on `input$…` must live inside `server` (or inside a module called by `server`), not out in the global scope.  \n 2.  You must *assign* `output$plot <- renderPlot(...)` inside your `server` function so that Shiny knows about it.  \n 3.  When you call your own reactives you must use parentheses, e.g. `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()`.  \n\nOnce you restructure your app that way the “Can’t read output ‘plot’” error will go away and you should see your ggplot."

The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submission correctly addresses the Shiny app error according to the criterion.\n\nThe criterion identifies the core problem as having a standalone `output$plot` reference in the server function without properly defining it, and suggests moving the `output$plot` definition and rendering code into a proper server function.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n1. Identifies the exact same root cause - that `output$plot` is defined in the global scope but only referenced (not assigned) inside the server function\n2. Explains that all the reactive elements need to be inside the server function\n3. Provides a complete solution that properly moves the rendering code into the server function\n\nThe submission goes even further by:\n- Providing additional best practices (using `req()` to ensure reactives exist)\n- Explaining the need for parentheses when calling reactive expressions\n- Restructuring the code for better organization\n- Providing a more detailed explanation of how Shiny's reactivity works\n\nWhile the implementation details vary slightly from the criterion's example (the submission uses separate reactive expressions for inputs rather than directly referencing them), both approaches solve the core issue correctly. In fact, the submission's approach with explicit reactives often leads to cleaner, more maintainable code in complex Shiny apps.\n\nThe submission fully meets and exceeds the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

You have\n\n```r\n# this is in the “global” section of your script\noutput$plot <- renderPlot({ … })\n…\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input,output) {\n  # you only return output$plot here, you never *assign* it\n  output$plot\n})\n```\n\nShiny never wires your `renderPlot` into the server, so when Shiny goes looking for `output$plot` it doesn’t exist.\n\nThe fix is to move all of your reactives and your `renderPlot` *inside* the server function, for example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# load your data in the global scope\nKidney_Correlations_Data <-\n  read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\",\n                  \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\",\n                   \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # reactives *inside* server\n  ckd_condition <- reactive({\n    input$condition\n  })\n  visit_threshold <- reactive({\n    input$visit_threshold\n  })\n  \n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(ckd_condition(), visit_threshold())  # ensure they exist\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == ckd_condition(),\n        VISIT_COUNT > visit_threshold()\n      )\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data for that combination\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold >= 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n 1.  Everything that depends on `input$…` must live inside `server` (or inside a module called by `server`), not out in the global scope.  \n 2.  You must *assign* `output$plot <- renderPlot(...)` inside your `server` function so that Shiny knows about it.  \n 3.  When you call your own reactives you must use parentheses, e.g. `ckd_condition()` and `visit_threshold()`.  \n\nOnce you restructure your app that way the “Can’t read output ‘plot’” error will go away and you should see your ggplot.",

It keeps the `.groups = \"drop\"` parameter, which should have been removed\n3. The `summarise()` call has a different structure than what was specified\n\nThe criterion required the code to look \"exactly the same\" apart from the specific change, but the submission has reformatted the code significantly.

Instead you supply the same semantic via the `.match` argument to join_by(), e.g.:\n\n   library(dplyr)\n   # instead of\n   # left_join(df1, df2, join_by(key1 == key2, closest(dist1, dist2)))\n   # you do\n   left_join(\n     df1,\n     df2,\n     join_by(\n       key1 == key2,\n       .match = \"closest\"    # pick the row with the minimal distance\n     )\n   )\n\nThis is the **exported**/public API and will never raise “no visible binding” notes.\n\n### 2) If you really, really need the raw function\n\n   a) Refer to it explicitly (and acknowledge it’s internal) with triple-colon:\n\n         dplyr:::closest(…)\n   \n   b) If you absolutely must keep calling it as `closest()` you can quiet R CMD check by adding to one of your R files:\n\n         if (getRversion() >= \"2.15.1\") utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")\n\n   c) **Strong caveat**: you are now relying on an internal dplyr implementation detail that could change at any time.\n\n### 3) Don’t do an `@importFrom(dplyr, closest)` or `NAMESPACE: importFrom(dplyr, closest)`  \nThat will simply fail because `closest` isn’t exported from dplyr.  Your best bet is (1) above – use the public `.match` argument to `join_by()` – or (2) fall back to the triple-colon/globals hack if you absolutely must."

That is why:\n\n  ·  dplyr::closest()  \n     ## Error: 'closest' is not an exported object from 'namespace:dplyr'\n\nand yet you can type plain closest() in your interactive session (because it’s sitting on the search path) but your package checker/linter sees an unbound symbol.\n\n## What you should do\n\n### 1) Use the exported “.match” argument in join_by()\n\nAs of dplyr 1.1.0 (and better documented in 1.1.1) you no longer have to write a bare call to closest().  Instead you supply the same semantic via the `.match` argument to join_by(), e.g.:\n\n   library(dplyr)\n   # instead of\n   # left_join(df1, df2, join_by(key1 == key2, closest(dist1, dist2)))\n   # you do\n   left_join(\n     df1,\n     df2,\n     join_by(\n       key1 == key2,\n       .match = \"closest\"    # pick the row with the minimal distance\n     )\n   )\n\nThis is the **exported**/public API and will never raise “no visible binding” notes.\n\n### 2) If you really, really need the raw function\n\n   a) Refer to it explicitly (and acknowledge it’s internal) with triple-colon:\n\n         dplyr:::closest(…)\n   \n   b) If you absolutely must keep calling it as `closest()` you can quiet R CMD check by adding to one of your R files:\n\n         if (getRversion() >= \"2.15.1\") utils::globalVariables(\"closest\")\n\n   c) **Strong caveat**: you are now relying on an internal dplyr implementation detail that could change at any time.\n\n### 3) Don’t do an `@importFrom(dplyr, closest)` or `NAMESPACE: importFrom(dplyr, closest)`  \nThat will simply fail because `closest` isn’t exported from dplyr.  Your best bet is (1) above – use the public `.match` argument to `join_by()` – or (2) fall back to the triple-colon/globals hack if you absolutely must.",

The reason that an unqualified `closest()` works in your package is that, when dplyr is on your search path, `match.fun(\"closest\")` happily finds `dplyr:::closest`.  But CRAN checks and linters do not like you calling an invisible function without documenting or importing it.\n\nYou have basically three choices:\n\n 1.  Call it with triple-colon:\n    \n       dplyr:::closest(x, y)\n    \n    This will silence the error, but your linter will probably complain about a `:::` use.  You can either add a `# nolint` comment or configure your lintr to allow that one case.\n\n 2.  Copy/alias the function into your namespace and call it locally.  For example, in one of your R/*.R files put:\n    \n       #' @keywords internal\n       closest <- getFromNamespace(\"closest\", \"dplyr\")\n    \n    Make sure you have dplyr in Imports in your DESCRIPTION so that `getFromNamespace()` will succeed.  Now calls to `closest()` in your package are calls to your own function, and CRAN/lint know that `closest` is part of your package.\n\n 3.  Ask dplyr to export it or open a feature request.  If you think `closest()` is generally useful downstream, you could open an issue on dplyr asking them to export it.  Then in a future version you would be able to write `dplyr::closest()` for real.\n\nOption 2 is usually the cleanest compromise if you just want to stop the NOTES / lints today.
