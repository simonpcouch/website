Sitting around the living room over the weekend, someone asked "Which names that are also names of countries are most common?" We all gave guesses, and then I gave in to the urge to reach for my laptop and generate an answer that was authoritative enough for our purposes.

The data I can easily access answers a question more like: which names that are also English names of countries were most common in the USA from 1880 to 2017? Before you read further, **try to guess**!

## Setup

We'll use two CRAN packages to help answer this question:

* [babynames](https://hadley.github.io/babynames/), which contains a data frame by the same name containing counts of babies by name by year in the US.
* [countrycode](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/countrycode/#/), which contains a data frame that includes, among other things, (English) names of countries.

```{r}
#| label: install-1
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("countrycode", "babynames"))
```

Also, of course:

```{r}
#| label: install-2
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("tidyverse"))
```

Loading those up:

```{r}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| message: false
library(countrycode)
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's what the data on baby names looks like:

```{r}
#| label: babynames
babynames
```

And the country data:

```{r}
#| label: codelist
codelist
```

`country.name.en` is our ticket.

## The reveal

We can use some of the core verbs from dplyr to answer our question:

```{r}
#| label: top-names
top_names <-
  babynames %>%
  # only keep names that are also English country names.
  filter(name %in% codelist$country.name.en) %>%
  # then, for each name...
  group_by(name) %>%
  # take the sum of the counts across years, and...
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>%
  # show the highest counts at the top.
  arrange(desc(n))

top_names
```

Was your guess in the top three?^[I added this footnote so that you'd end up near the comments section. Let me know.]

## Bonus points

Now that we're here, of course, we have to get up to a little tomfoolery. How are those top names trending?

```{r}
#| label: plot names-by-year
#| fig.alt: "Percentage of babies named with the top five US names that are also English names of countries. Georgia used to be the most popular by far (around .2%) until the 1910s or so. Chad had a big push around 1975, peaking at .4% of babies, and Jordan its own around 1990, peaking around .5%, but both were short-lived."
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center
babynames %>%
  # only keep names that are in the top 5 from the previous result
  filter(name %in% top_names$name[1:5]) %>%
  # take a weighted average of the proportions across sex
  group_by(year, name) %>%
  summarize(prop = (sum(n) / sum(n/prop))) %>%
  mutate(pct = prop * 100) %>%
  # plot that feller
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = year, y = pct, color = name) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Percent", color = "Name") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.15, 0.75))
```

I initially found it somewhat surprising that there was so much variation in the proportion of Georgia's up until 1920, and then suddenly not. The only way I could explain that sudden shift would be a huge increase in the number of people generally right around 1920â€”more people, less noisy proportionâ€”but that didn't seem reasonable to me.

Turns out, that definitely happened:

```{r}
#| label: plot-pop
#| fig-cap: "Note this isn't necessarily the number of babies born per year in the U.S. as the data includes only those names/sexes/years corresponding to at least 5 babies."
#| fig-alt: "A line plot showing the number of babies per year in the US from 1880 to now. The important part for this part is that the number of babies per year skyrocketed from 500,000 to 2,500,000 between 1910 and 1920."
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: center
babynames %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = year, y = n) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Babies") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```

I know very little about the history of the country that I live in. Alas, happy holidays, yall.ðŸŽ„
