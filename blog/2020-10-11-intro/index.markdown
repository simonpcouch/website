Hi yall!

For a while now, I've wished I had a place to share some short posts on what I'm up to related to R, data science, and statistics. I decided I'd take a Sunday to get this subdomain up and running! This setup uses blogdown and is based on a fork of [Julia Silge's website](https://juliasilge.com/)!

There's more information about myself and what I work on on my [main website](https://simonpcouch.com).
