At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nLet's analyze the submitted code:\n\nThe solution correctly:\n1. Groups the data by ID\n2. Checks if any record has \"Type_II\" (using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`)\n3. For \"Type_I\" records, extracts the dates, sorts them, and checks if any adjacent dates differ by 90 days or less\n4. Combines these criteria with a logical OR operation\n5. Converts the result to 0/1 integers\n\nThe approach is logical and the code is correctly implemented. The author properly addresses both criteria and handles edge cases (like when there are fewer than 2 Type_I records for an ID).\n\nThe output matches the expected result shown in the task description:\n- 000000: Flag = 0\n- 000001 to 000005: Flag = 1\n- 000006: Flag = 0\n\nThis solution correctly uses tidyverse functions like `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and the pipe operator, as requested in the task.\n\nGRADE: C",

Groups the data by ID\n2. Checks if any record has \"Type_II\" (using `any(type == \"Type_II\")`)\n3. For \"Type_I\" records, extracts the dates, sorts them, and checks if any adjacent dates differ by 90 days or less\n4. Combines these criteria with a logical OR operation\n5. Converts the result to 0/1 integers\n\nThe approach is logical and the code is correctly implemented. The author properly addresses both criteria and handles edge cases (like when there are fewer than 2 Type_I records for an ID).\n\nThe output matches the expected result shown in the task description:\n- 000000: Flag = 0\n- 000001 to 000005: Flag = 1\n- 000006: Flag = 0\n\nThis solution correctly uses tidyverse functions like `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and the pipe operator, as requested in the task.\n\nGRADE: C"

The Flag is simply hasII OR hasI90.  \n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndf_flagged <- df %>%\n  group_by(ID) %>%\n  summarise(\n    # 1) does this ID have at least one Type_II?\n    hasII = any(type == \"Type_II\"),\n    # 2) extract the Type_I dates, sort them, \n    #    then check if any adjacent diff ≤ 90\n    hasI90 = {\n      di <- date[type == \"Type_I\"] %>% sort()\n      # need at least two dates\n      if(length(di) < 2) {\n        FALSE\n      } else {\n        any(diff(di) <= 90)\n      }\n    },\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  # final flag is TRUE if either condition is TRUE\n  mutate(\n    Flag = as.integer(hasII | hasI90)\n  ) %>%\n  select(ID, Flag)\n\ndf_flagged\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n#     ID    Flag\n#   <chr>  <int>\n# 1 000000     0\n# 2 000001     1\n# 3 000002     1\n# 4 000003     1\n# 5 000004     1\n# 6 000005     1\n# 7 000006     0\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `any(type==\"Type_II\")` picks up the “Type_II”‐cases.  \n- We pull out only the `\"Type_I\"` dates, sort them, and then do `diff(di)` to get the day‐differences of adjacent visits; if any of those ≤ 90, we set `hasI90 = TRUE`.  \n- Finally we OR them together and coerce to integer (so TRUE→1, FALSE→0).  \n\nThat gives you exactly the table you asked for.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submitted answer correctly meets the criterion for setting a conditional boolean flag based on two conditions:\n1. At least one instance of \"Type_II\"\n2. Two or more cases of \"Type_I\" that occur within at least 90 days of one another\n\nThe submitted solution:\n- Groups by ID correctly\n- Checks for the presence of Type_II with `any(type == \"Type_II\")`\n- For Type_I dates:\n  - Extracts and sorts the dates\n  - Checks if any adjacent dates in the sorted sequence have a difference ≤ 90 days\n  - Correctly handles the case where there are fewer than 2 Type_I dates\n- ORs these conditions together and converts to an integer (0/1)\n\nThe solution correctly produces the expected output as shown in the example. The approach is valid: if any pair of Type_I visits are within 90 days of each other, then the sorted sequence will contain at least one pair of adjacent values with a difference ≤ 90 days.\n\nThe explanation given is also correct and clear about why sorting and using `diff()` works for finding any pair within 90 days.\n\nThis solution fully satisfies the criterion - it correctly implements the logic for both conditions and combines them appropriately.\n\nGRADE: C",

          "explanation": "I need to assess the submitted answer against the criterion for visualizing temporal correlation of flight delays.\n\nThe criterion specifies that departure delay should be grouped by `origin` airport since delays at one airport shouldn't affect flights at other airports. The submission arranges by `time_hour, year, month, day, sched_dep_time` but doesn't group by origin, which is a significant problem. This means it's tracking the correlation between any consecutive flights in the dataset, rather than consecutive flights from the same airport.\n\nThe submission correctly:\n- Uses lag() to create the previous flight delay variable\n- Filters out NA values \n- Computes mean departure delays grouped by previous departure delay\n- Creates a visualization of the relationship\n\nHowever, it fails on a core requirement - it doesn't account for airport origin when determining which flight is \"previous.\" Since the task specifically asks about temporal correlation of delays (where earlier flights affect later ones from the same airport), this is a significant oversight.\n\nThe submission also provides a second approach with binned delays, which still has the same fundamental issue of not grouping by origin.\n\nBoth approaches handle NA values appropriately either through filtering or using na.rm=TRUE in the mean calculation.\n\nSince the submission demonstrates understanding of the lag() function and proper visualization techniques but misses the crucial requirement of grouping by origin airport, I would consider this partially correct.\n\nGRADE: P",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable.

Using the tidyverse and dplyr's `lag()`, write code to visualize the mean departure delay `dep_delay` of a flight on the y axis vs the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight on the x.\n***\n[Submission]: Here’s one way to do it.  We’ll\n\n1. sort each plane’s flights into time‐order  \n2. use lag() to grab the previous flight’s dep_delay  \n3. throw away the NA’s  \n4. group by the previous delay (we’ll use the exact integer minutes as our “bin”)  \n5. compute the mean of the next flight’s dep_delay  \n6. plot mean(dep_delay) vs. prev_dep_delay  \n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# 1. Order by plane and time, 2. tag each flight with the previous flight's delay\nfl_prev <- flights %>%\n  arrange(tailnum, year, month, day, sched_dep_time) %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  filter(!is.na(prev_dep_delay))\n\n# 3.–5. Compute the mean next‐flight delay for each value of prev_dep_delay\nagg <- fl_prev %>%\n  group_by(prev_dep_delay) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  # (optional) drop sparse prev_dep_delay bins\n  filter(n > 20)\n\n# 6. Plot\nagg %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = prev_dep_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", span = 0.3) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Delay of the previous flight (min)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay of the next flight (min)\",\n    title = \"How the delay of one flight predicts the next\",\n    subtitle = \"Each point is the average of all flights whose previous‐flight delay = x\"\n  )\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n  • `arrange(tailnum, … sched_dep_time) %>% group_by(tailnum) %>% mutate(prev_dep_delay = lag(dep_delay))`  \n    ensures that for each tail number we pull in the departure delay of its immediately preceding flight.  \n  • We then group by that `prev_dep_delay` (an integer number of minutes), take the mean of the current `dep_delay`,  \n    and finally plot mean(dep_delay) vs. prev_dep_delay.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll evaluate whether the submitted answer meets the criterion for correctly visualizing the temporal correlation of flight delays.\n\nThe criterion specifies that:\n1. The relevant departure delay should be grouped by `origin` (airport), not by `tailnum` (plane)\n2. The mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the lagged departure delay\n3. NAs must be handled appropriately\n\nLooking at the submission:\n\nIssues:\n- The submission groups by `tailnum` rather than `origin`. This is a significant conceptual error, as the question is asking about the temporal correlation of flight delays at an airport, not for a specific plane.\n- The submission arranges by plane and time, whereas it should arrange by airport and time.\n\nCorrect aspects:\n- The submission does properly calculate the mean departure delay for each value of the lagged departure delay\n- It handles NAs appropriately by filtering them out\n- The visualization approach (plotting mean delay vs. previous delay) is correct\n- The code syntax for using lag() is technically correct, just applied to the wrong grouping variable\n\nThis is a partial solution because the fundamental approach and technical implementation are correct, but the conceptual understanding of what to group by (airplane vs. airport) is incorrect. The solution would not correctly answer the question as asked, which specifically requires analyzing delays at the same airport.\n\nGRADE: P",

            "target": "Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same airport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged departure delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that those departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the submitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or small bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken, NAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

If the endpoint is meant to accept a JSON body, switch your request to POST.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: keep it as GET, push your params into the query string\n\nCurl example:\n\n```bash\ncurl -G \\\n  'https://your.api.host/your-endpoint' \\\n  --data-urlencode \"id=5\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"fechaInicial=2023-02-01\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"fechaFinal=2023-05-01\" \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx'\n```\n\nIn httr2:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- request(\"https://your.api.host/your-endpoint\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept      = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey      = \"xxxxxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\none2\n```\n\nNotice there is **no** `req_body_json()` because GETs normally don’t carry a body.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: switch to POST so you can send a JSON body\n\nIf the API is actually expecting a POST with a JSON payload, change both your curl and your httr2 call to use POST:\n\nCurl:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'https://your.api.host/your-endpoint' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'ApiKey: xxxxxxxx' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"fechaInicial\": \"2023-02-01\",\n    \"fechaFinal\": \"2023-05-01\"\n  }'\n```\n\nhttr2:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\none2 <- request(\"https://your.api.host/your-endpoint\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept       = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey       = \"xxxxxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(list(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )) %>%\n  req_perform()\n\none2\n```\n\nThat will avoid the 405 “Method Not Allowed” error. Always check the API docs to see whether they want GET + URL parameters or POST + JSON body.\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a missing `req_method(\"GET\")`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission is missing a `req_method(\"GET\")` in the provided code.\n\nIn the submission, the author presents two options:\n\n1. For keeping it as a GET request, they use:\n```r\none2 <- request(\"https://your.api.host/your-endpoint\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept      = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey      = \"xxxxxxxx\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_url_query(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_perform()\n```\n\n2. For switching to a POST request, they use:\n```r\none2 <- request(\"https://your.api.host/your-endpoint\") %>%\n  req_method(\"POST\") %>%\n  req_headers(\n    accept       = \"application/json\",\n    ApiKey       = \"xxxxxxxx\",\n    `Content-Type` = \"application/json\"\n  ) %>%\n  req_body_json(list(\n    id           = 5,\n    fechaInicial = \"2023-02-01\",\n    fechaFinal   = \"2023-05-01\"\n  )) %>%\n  req_perform()\n```\n\nLooking at the first option, there is indeed no explicit `req_method(\"GET\")`. However, in httr2, GET is the default HTTP method when none is specified. So while it's not explicitly included, the code would still perform a GET request.\n\nThat said, the criterion specifically asks whether `req_method(\"GET\")` is missing, and technically it is missing from the first option where a GET request is intended.\n\nGRADE: P",

          "answer": "In ggplot2 the reason you get an empty key for “d” is simply that there are no points with z==\"d\" in your data, so when you say drop = FALSE you force the legend to show the level, but since there is no geom drawing a green point for “d” it leaves the key blank.  \n\nThe easiest way to force a filled‐in dot in the legend is to use guide_legend()’s override.aes.  You tell the legend “even for levels that have no data, draw a point of this shape/size/etc.”.  For example:\n\n```\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x = 1:3,\n  y = 1:3,\n  z = factor(letters[1:3], levels = letters[1:4])\n)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x,y,colour=z)) +\n  geom_point(size=3) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,\n    values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    colour = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(\n        shape = 16,    # force solid circle\n        size  = 3      # same size as your geom_point()\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nWhat happens here is:\n\n- `drop = FALSE` keeps “d” in the legend\n- `override.aes` tells the legend to draw **all** keys using `shape = 16` and `size = 3`\n- since you supplied a colour for “d” in your manual scale, the legend now draws a green circle next to “d” even though you never actually plotted a data point with z==\"d\".\n\nAlternative trick without override.aes\n\nIf you really want ggplot to _think_ there was a data point for “d”, you can add one dummy row:\n\n```r\ndf2 <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x=Inf, y=Inf, z=factor(\"d\", levels=levels(df$z)))\n)\nggplot(df2, aes(x,y,colour=z)) +\n  geom_point(data=filter(df2, !is.infinite(x)), size=3) +\n  geom_point(data=filter(df2,  is.infinite(x)), alpha=0) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    drop   = FALSE,\n    values = c(a=\"red\", b=\"blue\", c=\"yellow\", d=\"green\")\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(1,3), ylim=c(1,3))\n```\n\nHere you place a fake “d” point _off_ the plot region (Inf,Inf) and make it invisible (`alpha=0`) so it never shows up in the panel, but it _does_ force the legend to draw a filled green point.

For example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ndf <- data.frame(x = 1:3,\n                 y = 1:3,\n                 z = factor(letters[1:3],\n                            levels = letters[1:4]))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y, colour = z)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    values = c(a = \"red\",\n               b = \"blue\",\n               c = \"yellow\",\n               d = \"green\"),\n    drop   = FALSE\n  ) +\n  guides(\n    colour = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(   # force every legend key to draw a filled circle\n        shape = 16,\n        size  = 4\n      )\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n 1.  `drop = FALSE` tells ggplot to keep the unused level “d” in the legend.\n 2.  `override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 4)` tells the legend draw routine\n     to *always* put a solid circle of size 4 in each key.  It does **not**\n     override the colour itself, so each key still uses the correct colour\n     from your scale, you’re only supplying the shape/size to be drawn.\n 3.  You now get a full legend with a green dot next to “d.”\n\nIf you wanted to do it all inside the scale, you can also do:\n\n```r\nscale_colour_manual(\n  values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\"),\n  drop   = FALSE,\n  guide  = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 4))\n)\n```\n\nbut either way, `override.aes` is the key to forcing a glyph into empty legend keys.\n***\n[Criterion]: Also add `show.legend = TRUE` to the `geom_point()` layer, like so:\n\n```\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = z), show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(drop = FALSE,\n                     values = c(a = \"red\",\n                                b = \"blue\",\n                                c = \"yellow\",\n                                d = \"green\"))\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

Curl (and therefore httr2) chokes on those “illegal” characters and gives you the “malformed input” error.\n\nThere are two easy ways to solve it:\n\n1) Manually URL-encode the `address` before you glue it in:\n\n```r\nlibrary(curl)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress    <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\naddress_q  <- curl::curl_escape(address)\nurl        <- glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={address_q}\")\n\nresp <- request(url) %>% \n  req_perform()\n```\n\nor\n\n```r\n# base‐R URLencode\naddress_q <- utils::URLencode(address)\nurl       <- sprintf(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q=%s\", address_q)\n\nresp <- request(url) %>% \n  req_perform()\n```\n\n2) Let httr2 do the escaping for you by using `req_url_query()`:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\n\nresp <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address) %>%    # httr2 will %::encode() \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\n  req_perform()\n```\n\nThat will produce a well-formed GET request:\n\n```\nGET /search?q=Prince%20st.%2C%20New%20York%2010012 HTTP/2\n```\n\nand you should get back the usual GeoJSON/JSON results.  \n\nNotes:\n\n- As far as I can tell https://geocode.maps.co does _not_ require an API key, so you can drop it unless your particular endpoint really needs one.  \n- If you do need an API key, just add it as another entry to `req_url_query(api_key = \"your_key\")`.  \n\nOnce you percent-encode your parameters (or use `req_url_query`), the “malformed URL” error will go away.",

Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in the `if (scale$is_discrete())` block\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the `else` block\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of modifying how the breaks are stored, it adds a new block of code that:\n1. Checks if the scale is discrete and labels are derived\n2. Gets the break values (handling if they're a function)\n3. Checks if the breaks have names\n4. If so, sets `self$labels` to those names\n\nWhile the submission's approach might achieve the desired functionality, it doesn't match the specific changes required by the criterion.

What we do is, as soon as we know that we’re dealing with a discrete scale and that the user hasn’t supplied any custom `labels`, we pull the names off of the `breaks` (if there are any) and use those as our `labels`.\n\nIn the `AxisSecondary` proto you would change the `init()` method.  Here’s a minimal patch (i.e. a unified‐diff) showing where to insert the extra test:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) {\n       self$name <- scale$name\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) {\n       self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     }\n\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         # … existing continuous‐breaks logic …\n       }\n     }\n\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n+    ## NEW: if we're on a discrete scale, and the user did NOT supply\n+    ##      any labels, but the breaks vector *does* have names,\n+    ##      then use those names as the labels:\n+    if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # self$breaks may be a function or a vector at this point:\n+      brk_vals <- self$breaks\n+      if (is.function(brk_vals)) {\n+        # ask it for its values\n+        brk_vals <- brk_vals(scale$get_breaks())\n+      }\n+      nm <- names(brk_vals)\n+      if (!is.null(nm) && any(nzchar(nm))) {\n+        self$labels <- nm\n+      }\n+    }\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n       self$labels <- scale$labels\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n       self$guide <- scale$guide\n     }\n   },\n```\n\nWhat this does is:\n\n1.  After the breaks have been inherited from the primary scale, but *before* we fall back to “use the primary scale’s labels,” we check:\n\n    a.  Is the scale discrete?  \n    b.  Has the user *not* provided any custom labels?  (`is.derived(self$labels)` is `TRUE` → we’re still using the default)  \n    c.  Does our break‐vector actually carry `names()`?  \n\n2.  If so, we set `self$labels <- names(brk_vals)`.  From that point on the axis‐drawing machinery will use your names as the labels on the secondary axis.  \n\nThis small change preserves exactly the existing behavior in all other cases, but any time you have a discrete secondary axis with a named‐vector of breaks, the names of that vector will appear on the axis by default.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

What we do is, as soon as we know that we’re dealing with a discrete scale and that the user hasn’t supplied any custom `labels`, we pull the names off of the `breaks` (if there are any) and use those as our `labels`.\n\nIn the `AxisSecondary` proto you would change the `init()` method.  Here’s a minimal patch (i.e. a unified‐diff) showing where to insert the extra test:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) {\n       self$name <- scale$name\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) {\n       self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     }\n\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         # … existing continuous‐breaks logic …\n       }\n     }\n\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n+    ## NEW: if we're on a discrete scale, and the user did NOT supply\n+    ##      any labels, but the breaks vector *does* have names,\n+    ##      then use those names as the labels:\n+    if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # self$breaks may be a function or a vector at this point:\n+      brk_vals <- self$breaks\n+      if (is.function(brk_vals)) {\n+        # ask it for its values\n+        brk_vals <- brk_vals(scale$get_breaks())\n+      }\n+      nm <- names(brk_vals)\n+      if (!is.null(nm) && any(nzchar(nm))) {\n+        self$labels <- nm\n+      }\n+    }\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n       self$labels <- scale$labels\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n       self$guide <- scale$guide\n     }\n   },\n```\n\nWhat this does is:\n\n1.  After the breaks have been inherited from the primary scale, but *before* we fall back to “use the primary scale’s labels,” we check:\n\n    a.  Is the scale discrete?  \n    b.  Has the user *not* provided any custom labels?  (`is.derived(self$labels)` is `TRUE` → we’re still using the default)  \n    c.  Does our break‐vector actually carry `names()`?  \n\n2.  If so, we set `self$labels <- names(brk_vals)`.  From that point on the axis‐drawing machinery will use your names as the labels on the secondary axis.  \n\nThis small change preserves exactly the existing behavior in all other cases, but any time you have a discrete secondary axis with a named‐vector of breaks, the names of that vector will appear on the axis by default.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion.\n\nThe criterion specifies two specific changes needed to ensure that when discrete breaks have names, they'll be used as labels by default:\n\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` in the `if (scale$is_discrete())` block\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` in the `else` block\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of modifying how the breaks are stored, it adds a new block of code that:\n1. Checks if the scale is discrete and labels are derived\n2. Gets the break values (handling if they're a function)\n3. Checks if the breaks have names\n4. If so, sets `self$labels` to those names\n\nWhile the submission's approach might achieve the desired functionality, it doesn't match the specific changes required by the criterion. The criterion specifies precise code modifications to preserve the names of breaks when getting them from the scale and when mapping them.\n\nThe submission is a more complex solution that addresses the problem differently, and does not implement the exact changes specified in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: I",

                      "text": "Below is one way to make “named‐breaks get their names as the labels” in the secondary–axis machinery.  What we do is, as soon as we know that we’re dealing with a discrete scale and that the user hasn’t supplied any custom `labels`, we pull the names off of the `breaks` (if there are any) and use those as our `labels`.\n\nIn the `AxisSecondary` proto you would change the `init()` method.  Here’s a minimal patch (i.e. a unified‐diff) showing where to insert the extra test:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) {\n       self$name <- scale$name\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) {\n       self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     }\n\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         # … existing continuous‐breaks logic …\n       }\n     }\n\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n+    ## NEW: if we're on a discrete scale, and the user did NOT supply\n+    ##      any labels, but the breaks vector *does* have names,\n+    ##      then use those names as the labels:\n+    if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # self$breaks may be a function or a vector at this point:\n+      brk_vals <- self$breaks\n+      if (is.function(brk_vals)) {\n+        # ask it for its values\n+        brk_vals <- brk_vals(scale$get_breaks())\n+      }\n+      nm <- names(brk_vals)\n+      if (!is.null(nm) && any(nzchar(nm))) {\n+        self$labels <- nm\n+      }\n+    }\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n       self$labels <- scale$labels\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n       self$guide <- scale$guide\n     }\n   },\n```\n\nWhat this does is:\n\n1.  After the breaks have been inherited from the primary scale, but *before* we fall back to “use the primary scale’s labels,” we check:\n\n    a.  Is the scale discrete?  \n    b.  Has the user *not* provided any custom labels?  (`is.derived(self$labels)` is `TRUE` → we’re still using the default)  \n    c.  Does our break‐vector actually carry `names()`?  \n\n2.  If so, we set `self$labels <- names(brk_vals)`.  From that point on the axis‐drawing machinery will use your names as the labels on the secondary axis.  \n\nThis small change preserves exactly the existing behavior in all other cases, but any time you have a discrete secondary axis with a named‐vector of breaks, the names of that vector will appear on the axis by default."

                  "text": "Below is one way to make “named‐breaks get their names as the labels” in the secondary–axis machinery.  What we do is, as soon as we know that we’re dealing with a discrete scale and that the user hasn’t supplied any custom `labels`, we pull the names off of the `breaks` (if there are any) and use those as our `labels`.\n\nIn the `AxisSecondary` proto you would change the `init()` method.  Here’s a minimal patch (i.e. a unified‐diff) showing where to insert the extra test:\n\n```diff\n@@ AxisSecondary <- ggproto(\"AxisSecondary\", NULL,\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$name) && !is.waiver(scale$name)) {\n       self$name <- scale$name\n     }\n\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks)) {\n       self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     }\n\n     if (is.waiver(self$breaks)) {\n       if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n         self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n       } else {\n         # … existing continuous‐breaks logic …\n       }\n     }\n\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n+    ## NEW: if we're on a discrete scale, and the user did NOT supply\n+    ##      any labels, but the breaks vector *does* have names,\n+    ##      then use those names as the labels:\n+    if (scale$is_discrete() && is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # self$breaks may be a function or a vector at this point:\n+      brk_vals <- self$breaks\n+      if (is.function(brk_vals)) {\n+        # ask it for its values\n+        brk_vals <- brk_vals(scale$get_breaks())\n+      }\n+      nm <- names(brk_vals)\n+      if (!is.null(nm) && any(nzchar(nm))) {\n+        self$labels <- nm\n+      }\n+    }\n+    ## -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n       self$labels <- scale$labels\n     }\n     if (is.derived(self$guide)) {\n       self$guide <- scale$guide\n     }\n   },\n```\n\nWhat this does is:\n\n1.  After the breaks have been inherited from the primary scale, but *before* we fall back to “use the primary scale’s labels,” we check:\n\n    a.  Is the scale discrete?  \n    b.  Has the user *not* provided any custom labels?  (`is.derived(self$labels)` is `TRUE` → we’re still using the default)  \n    c.  Does our break‐vector actually carry `names()`?  \n\n2.  If so, we set `self$labels <- names(brk_vals)`.  From that point on the axis‐drawing machinery will use your names as the labels on the secondary axis.  \n\nThis small change preserves exactly the existing behavior in all other cases, but any time you have a discrete secondary axis with a named‐vector of breaks, the names of that vector will appear on the axis by default.",

Usually this is [guide_axis()].\n#'\n#' @details\n#' `sec_axis()` is used to create the specifications for a secondary axis.\n#' Except for the `trans` argument any of the arguments can be set to\n#' `derive()` which would result in the secondary axis inheriting the\n#' settings from the primary axis.\n#'\n#' `dup_axis()` is provide as a shorthand for creating a secondary axis that\n#' is a duplication of the primary axis, effectively mirroring the primary axis.\n#'\n#' As of v3.1, date and datetime scales have limited secondary axis capabilities.\n#' Unlike other continuous scales, secondary axis transformations for date and datetime scales\n#' must respect their primary POSIX data structure.\n#' This means they may only be transformed via addition or subtraction, e.g.\n#' `~ . + hms::hms(days = 8)`, or\n#' `~ . - 8*60*60`. Nonlinear transformations will return an error.\n#' To produce a time-since-event secondary axis in this context, users\n#' may consider adapting secondary axis labels.\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n#'   geom_point()\n#'\n#' #

Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names when getting the breaks for discrete scales\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names when mapping breaks\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of making these specific changes, it:\n1. Adds a new block of code to check if the scale is discrete, the labels are derived, and the breaks have names\n2. If these conditions are met, it extracts the names from the breaks and sets them as labels\n3.

The idea is to catch the special case of a discrete secondary axis whose user‐supplied (or derived) breaks carry names, and to promote those names into the axis‐labels before we ever hand off to the continuous break‐calculator below.\n\n1.  In your `AxisSecondary$init` method, find the two lines\n\n      if (is.derived(self$breaks))  self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n      …\n      if (is.derived(self$labels))  self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n2.  Replace the `self$labels` line with something like this (we pull it *before* the normal “derive” so that named breaks get priority):\n\n```diff\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     # name and breaks inheritance (unchanged)\n     if (is.derived(self$name)   && !is.waiver(scale$name))   self$name   <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) && !scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) &&  scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n\n+    # —— NEW BLOCK ———\n+    # If this is a discrete secondary axis, and the breaks carry names,\n+    # use those names as the default labels:\n+    if ( scale$is_discrete()\n+      && is.derived(self$labels)\n+      && !is.null(names(self$breaks))\n+    ) {\n+      # self$breaks is e.g. c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n+      raw_breaks <- self$breaks\n+      raw_names  <- names(raw_breaks)\n+      raw_vals   <- unname(raw_breaks)\n+      # a simple vector of labels, same length/order as raw_vals:\n+      self$labels <- raw_names\n+    }\n+    else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # fall back to inheriting the primary‐axis labels\n+      self$labels <- scale$labels\n+    }\n```\n\n3.  That’s it.  What we’ve done is, in the very common discrete case, look for a character/factor break vector that has names on it already:\n\n    breaks <- c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n\n  and pulled out `c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` to be the secondary‐axis labels.  \n\nBecause we do it ahead of the normal `is.derived(self$labels)` branch, users still have the full power to override with their own label function or vector if they want.  If they don’t, and they did supply named breaks, they’ll see the names.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

The idea is to catch the special case of a discrete secondary axis whose user‐supplied (or derived) breaks carry names, and to promote those names into the axis‐labels before we ever hand off to the continuous break‐calculator below.\n\n1.  In your `AxisSecondary$init` method, find the two lines\n\n      if (is.derived(self$breaks))  self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n      …\n      if (is.derived(self$labels))  self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n2.  Replace the `self$labels` line with something like this (we pull it *before* the normal “derive” so that named breaks get priority):\n\n```diff\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     # name and breaks inheritance (unchanged)\n     if (is.derived(self$name)   && !is.waiver(scale$name))   self$name   <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) && !scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) &&  scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n\n+    # —— NEW BLOCK ———\n+    # If this is a discrete secondary axis, and the breaks carry names,\n+    # use those names as the default labels:\n+    if ( scale$is_discrete()\n+      && is.derived(self$labels)\n+      && !is.null(names(self$breaks))\n+    ) {\n+      # self$breaks is e.g. c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n+      raw_breaks <- self$breaks\n+      raw_names  <- names(raw_breaks)\n+      raw_vals   <- unname(raw_breaks)\n+      # a simple vector of labels, same length/order as raw_vals:\n+      self$labels <- raw_names\n+    }\n+    else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # fall back to inheriting the primary‐axis labels\n+      self$labels <- scale$labels\n+    }\n```\n\n3.  That’s it.  What we’ve done is, in the very common discrete case, look for a character/factor break vector that has names on it already:\n\n    breaks <- c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n\n  and pulled out `c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` to be the secondary‐axis labels.  \n\nBecause we do it ahead of the normal `is.derived(self$labels)` branch, users still have the full power to override with their own label function or vector if they want.  If they don’t, and they did supply named breaks, they’ll see the names.\n***\n[Criterion]: ```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n      } \n```\n\n...should be changed to:\n\n```\n      if (scale$is_discrete()) {\n        self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())\n      } \n```\n\nand, later, on:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)\n    }\n```\n\ncan be changed to:\n\n```\n    else {\n      breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))\n    }\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed, but both changes are needed.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll evaluate the submission against the criterion.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific changes:\n1. Change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())` to preserve names when getting the breaks for discrete scales\n2. Change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))` to preserve names when mapping breaks\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of making these specific changes, it:\n1. Adds a new block of code to check if the scale is discrete, the labels are derived, and the breaks have names\n2. If these conditions are met, it extracts the names from the breaks and sets them as labels\n3. Otherwise, it falls back to inheriting the primary axis labels\n\nWhile the submission's approach might address the same issue (ensuring named breaks are used as labels by default), it does not make the specific changes required by the criterion. The submission focuses on extracting names from breaks and setting them as labels, rather than ensuring names are preserved during the break handling process.\n\nThe criterion specified very particular code changes, and the submission didn't implement those exact changes.\n\nGRADE: I",

The idea is to catch the special case of a discrete secondary axis whose user‐supplied (or derived) breaks carry names, and to promote those names into the axis‐labels before we ever hand off to the continuous break‐calculator below.\n\n1.  In your `AxisSecondary$init` method, find the two lines\n\n      if (is.derived(self$breaks))  self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n      …\n      if (is.derived(self$labels))  self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n2.  Replace the `self$labels` line with something like this (we pull it *before* the normal “derive” so that named breaks get priority):\n\n```diff\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     # name and breaks inheritance (unchanged)\n     if (is.derived(self$name)   && !is.waiver(scale$name))   self$name   <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) && !scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) &&  scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n\n+    # —— NEW BLOCK ———\n+    # If this is a discrete secondary axis, and the breaks carry names,\n+    # use those names as the default labels:\n+    if ( scale$is_discrete()\n+      && is.derived(self$labels)\n+      && !is.null(names(self$breaks))\n+    ) {\n+      # self$breaks is e.g. c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n+      raw_breaks <- self$breaks\n+      raw_names  <- names(raw_breaks)\n+      raw_vals   <- unname(raw_breaks)\n+      # a simple vector of labels, same length/order as raw_vals:\n+      self$labels <- raw_names\n+    }\n+    else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # fall back to inheriting the primary‐axis labels\n+      self$labels <- scale$labels\n+    }\n```\n\n3.  That’s it.  What we’ve done is, in the very common discrete case, look for a character/factor break vector that has names on it already:\n\n    breaks <- c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n\n  and pulled out `c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` to be the secondary‐axis labels.  \n\nBecause we do it ahead of the normal `is.derived(self$labels)` branch, users still have the full power to override with their own label function or vector if they want.  If they don’t, and they did supply named breaks, they’ll see the names."

The idea is to catch the special case of a discrete secondary axis whose user‐supplied (or derived) breaks carry names, and to promote those names into the axis‐labels before we ever hand off to the continuous break‐calculator below.\n\n1.  In your `AxisSecondary$init` method, find the two lines\n\n      if (is.derived(self$breaks))  self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n      …\n      if (is.derived(self$labels))  self$labels <- scale$labels\n\n2.  Replace the `self$labels` line with something like this (we pull it *before* the normal “derive” so that named breaks get priority):\n\n```diff\n   init = function(self, scale) {\n     if (self$empty()) {\n       return()\n     }\n     transform <- self$trans\n     if (!is.function(transform)) {\n       cli::cli_abort(\"Transformation for secondary axes must be a function.\")\n     }\n\n     # name and breaks inheritance (unchanged)\n     if (is.derived(self$name)   && !is.waiver(scale$name))   self$name   <- scale$name\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) && !scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$breaks\n     if (is.derived(self$breaks) &&  scale$is_discrete())     self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()\n\n+    # —— NEW BLOCK ———\n+    # If this is a discrete secondary axis, and the breaks carry names,\n+    # use those names as the default labels:\n+    if ( scale$is_discrete()\n+      && is.derived(self$labels)\n+      && !is.null(names(self$breaks))\n+    ) {\n+      # self$breaks is e.g. c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n+      raw_breaks <- self$breaks\n+      raw_names  <- names(raw_breaks)\n+      raw_vals   <- unname(raw_breaks)\n+      # a simple vector of labels, same length/order as raw_vals:\n+      self$labels <- raw_names\n+    }\n+    else if (is.derived(self$labels)) {\n+      # fall back to inheriting the primary‐axis labels\n+      self$labels <- scale$labels\n+    }\n```\n\n3.  That’s it.  What we’ve done is, in the very common discrete case, look for a character/factor break vector that has names on it already:\n\n    breaks <- c(A = \"apple\", B = \"banana\", C = \"cherry\")\n\n  and pulled out `c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\")` to be the secondary‐axis labels.  \n\nBecause we do it ahead of the normal `is.derived(self$labels)` branch, users still have the full power to override with their own label function or vector if they want.  If they don’t, and they did supply named breaks, they’ll see the names.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion which suggests specific changes to handle named discrete breaks in ggplot2's secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific changes:\n1. In the init function, change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. In the break_info function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving the names through setNames() at these specific points, it:\n1. Adds a new block of code to the init function that checks for named breaks\n2. Extracts those names into self$labels\n3. Explicitly unnames the breaks\n\nWhile the submission would likely achieve the same end result (using names from discrete breaks as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes requested in the criterion. The criterion specifies precise line-by-line changes that need to be made, and the submission implements a different solution altogether.\n\nThe criterion's approach maintains the names throughout the process, while the submission extracts them early and manages them separately. Both approaches might work, but they're fundamentally different implementations.\n\nGRADE: I",

              "response": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion which suggests specific changes to handle named discrete breaks in ggplot2's secondary axes.\n\nThe criterion suggests two specific changes:\n1. In the init function, change `self$breaks <- scale$get_breaks()` to `self$breaks <- setNames(scale$get_breaks())`\n2. In the break_info function, change `breaks <- scale$map(self$breaks)` to `breaks <- setNames(scale$map(self$breaks), names(self$breaks))`\n\nThe submission takes a different approach. Instead of preserving the names through setNames() at these specific points, it:\n1. Adds a new block of code to the init function that checks for named breaks\n2. Extracts those names into self$labels\n3. Explicitly unnames the breaks\n\nWhile the submission would likely achieve the same end result (using names from discrete breaks as labels), it doesn't implement the specific changes requested in the criterion. The criterion specifies precise line-by-line changes that need to be made, and the submission implements a different solution altogether.\n\nThe criterion's approach maintains the names throughout the process, while the submission extracts them early and manages them separately.

It only pulls off names if the user supplied their own `breaks=` (and those breaks are named).\n4.  If the user *also* supplies `labels=`, then we respect those and do *not* override.\n\nAfter that change, the usual downstream machinery (`break_info()`, `create_scale()`, etc.) will pick up your newly‐populated `self$labels` vector and draw them."

It filters out flights with missing tailnums with `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`, which is acceptable per the criterion.\n\n2. It groups by tailnum using `group_by(tailnum)`.\n\n3. It calculates the number of flights per tailnum with `n_flights = n()` and the proportion of NA arr_delays with `prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, correctly using `is.na()` to identify missing values.\n\n4. It filters to only include tailnums with at least 100 flights using `filter(n_flights >= 100)`.\n\n5. It sorts by the proportion of NA values in descending order with `arrange(desc(prop_na))`.\n\n6. It takes only the top result with `slice(1)`.\n\nThe main difference from the criterion's examples is the implementation approach. The submission uses a two-step process where it first counts flights and then filters, rather than using the filter(n() > 100) approach directly. However, this is functionally equivalent and follows standard dplyr conventions.\n\nThe submission correctly ignores the planes data in the main solution (though provides an optional extension to join with it after solving the core problem).\n\nOverall, the solution correctly addresses all requirements and follows a logical approach to solve the problem.\n\nGRADE: C",

It filters to only include tailnums with at least 100 flights using `filter(n_flights >= 100)`.\n\n5. It sorts by the proportion of NA values in descending order with `arrange(desc(prop_na))`.\n\n6. It takes only the top result with `slice(1)`.\n\nThe main difference from the criterion's examples is the implementation approach. The submission uses a two-step process where it first counts flights and then filters, rather than using the filter(n() > 100) approach directly. However, this is functionally equivalent and follows standard dplyr conventions.\n\nThe submission correctly ignores the planes data in the main solution (though provides an optional extension to join with it after solving the core problem).\n\nOverall, the solution correctly addresses all requirements and follows a logical approach to solve the problem.\n\nGRADE: C",

We first drop flights with missing tailnum, group by tailnum, compute the total number of flights and the proportion of missing arrival‐delays, keep only tailnums with ≥100 flights, and finally pick the one with the largest NA‐rate:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%                  # drop flights with no tail number\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%                        \n  summarise(\n    n_flights  = n(),                          # total flights\n    prop_na    = mean(is.na(arr_delay))        # fraction of flights with NA arr_delay\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%                 # at least 100 flights\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1) %>%                # tailnum with highest NA‐rate\n  pull(tailnum)                                # return just the tailnum\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`  \n   removes any rows where we don’t even know the plane’s tail number.  \n2. `summarise(n_flights = n(), prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay)))`  \n  – `n()` is the total flights for that plane  \n  – `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` is the proportion of those flights whose `arr_delay` is `NA`.  \n3. `filter(n_flights >= 100)`  \n   only keeps planes with at least 100 flights.  \n4. `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)`  \n   picks the row (tailnum) with the highest missing‐rate.  \n5. `pull(tailnum)`  \n   extracts that tailnum as a character vector of length 1.\n***\n[Criterion]: There are three main steps here:\n\n1) A grouped filter: only keep rows in `flights` that have > 100 rows. Notably, no persistent summarization across rows should happen here. \n2) A grouped summarize: taking `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` will determine the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s. Notably, `mean(arr_delay == \"NA\")` or `mean(arr_delay == NA)` is not correct.\n3) Arrange by the resulting column in descending order.\n\nThe `planes` data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay)), \n    .by = tailnum\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nWith the old `group_by()` syntax:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nThe `ungroup()` and `group_by()` in the middle can be omitted, since the same grouping variable is used for both:\n\n```\nflights %>%\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  filter(n() > 100) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_na_arr_delay = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))\n```\n\nSome `tailnum`s are NA, but there's not enough context in the question to determine that; correct answers can include a line along the lines of `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I'll assess whether the submission meets the criterion by checking if it correctly implements the three main steps required.\n\nThe submission does:\n\n1. Handle the grouping and filtering correctly, but in a different way than specified in the criterion. Instead of using `filter(n() > 100, .by = tailnum)`, it uses `group_by(tailnum)` followed by `summarise(n_flights = n())` and then `filter(n_flights >= 100)`. This approach is valid and achieves the same result.\n\n2. Correctly calculate the proportion of NA values using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`, which matches the criterion's specification.\n\n3. Instead of using `arrange(desc(mean_na_arr_delay))`, the submission uses `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)`, which is a different but valid approach to find the highest value.\n\n4. The submission also correctly handles NA tailnums with `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`, which the criterion notes is acceptable.\n\n5. The submission goes one step further by using `pull(tailnum)` to extract just the tailnum value, which is not explicitly required by the criterion but is a reasonable interpretation of the task to \"find the tailnum\".\n\nThe submission uses a different but valid approach to achieve each of the required steps. The logic is sound and would produce the correct result.\n\nGRADE: C",

We first drop flights with missing tailnum, group by tailnum, compute the total number of flights and the proportion of missing arrival‐delays, keep only tailnums with ≥100 flights, and finally pick the one with the largest NA‐rate:\n\n```r\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nflights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%                  # drop flights with no tail number\n  group_by(tailnum) %>%                        \n  summarise(\n    n_flights  = n(),                          # total flights\n    prop_na    = mean(is.na(arr_delay))        # fraction of flights with NA arr_delay\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n_flights >= 100) %>%                 # at least 100 flights\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1) %>%                # tailnum with highest NA‐rate\n  pull(tailnum)                                # return just the tailnum\n```\n\nExplanation of the key steps:\n\n1. `filter(!is.na(tailnum))`  \n   removes any rows where we don’t even know the plane’s tail number.  \n2. `summarise(n_flights = n(), prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay)))`  \n  – `n()` is the total flights for that plane  \n  – `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` is the proportion of those flights whose `arr_delay` is `NA`.  \n3. `filter(n_flights >= 100)`  \n   only keeps planes with at least 100 flights.  \n4. `slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)`  \n   picks the row (tailnum) with the highest missing‐rate.  \n5. `pull(tailnum)`  \n   extracts that tailnum as a character vector of length 1."

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate whether the submission meets the criterion for finding the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NA `arr_delay`s that has flown at least 100 flights.\n\nThe criterion specifies three main steps:\n1. Filter to keep only `tailnum`s that have > 100 flights\n2. Calculate the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s for each `tailnum`\n3. Arrange in descending order by that proportion\n\nThe submission approaches this differently than the example solutions:\n\n```r\nflights %>%\n  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>%              \n  group_by(tailnum) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total_flights = n(),\n    prop_na = mean(is.na(arr_delay))\n  ) %>%\n  filter(total_flights >= 100) %>%\n  slice_max(prop_na, n = 1)\n```\n\nKey differences:\n- The submission first filters out NA `tailnum`s, which is noted as acceptable\n- It calculates the total flights and then filters afterward, rather than using `filter(n() > 100)`\n- It uses `slice_max()` instead of `arrange(desc())` to get the top result\n\nDespite these differences, the submission correctly:\n- Handles the filtering for rows with sufficient flights (≥ 100)\n- Properly calculates the proportion of NA `arr_delay`s using `mean(is.na(arr_delay))`\n- Identifies the `tailnum` with the highest proportion of NAs\n\nThe approach is different but valid and would yield the correct result. The filtering after summarization is equivalent to the grouped filter before summarization in this case.\n\nGRADE: C",

When you write\n\n  mutate(…, by = c(id, date))\n\nwhat R sees is “take the two columns `id` and `date`, concatenate them into one big vector (length = 2 × nrow), and try to recycle that into my n-row tibble” – hence the “must be size 2909492 or 1, not 5818984” error.\n\nThere are two ways to fix it:\n\n1.  Use `.by` (dplyr 1.1.0+)\n\n    ```r\n    library(dplyr)\n\n    df %>%\n      mutate(\n        new_col = some_function(...),\n        .by    = c(id, date)\n      )\n    ```\n    Here you are telling dplyr “group on `id` and `date` just for this one mutate() call.”\n\n2.  Or do a classic `group_by()` / `ungroup()`:\n\n    ```r\n    df %>%\n      group_by(id, date) %>%\n      mutate(new_col = some_function(...)) %>%\n      ungroup()\n    ```\n\nEither will give you the behavior you expect.

There are two remedies:\n\n1)  **Use the new `.by=` argument in dplyr ≥1.1.0**  \n    Give it the column *names*, not the column values.  You can do that either unquoted or as strings.\n\n    ```r\n    # unquoted:\n    df %>%\n      mutate(\n        new_var = some_function(…),\n        .by     = c(id, date)\n      )\n\n    # or quoted:\n    df %>%\n      mutate(\n        new_var = some_function(…),\n        .by     = c(\"id\", \"date\")\n      )\n    ```\n\n2)  **If you’re on dplyr <1.1.0** (or prefer the classic syntax), just fall back to `group_by()`:\n\n    ```r\n    df %>%\n      group_by(id, date) %>%\n      mutate(new_var = some_function(…)) %>%\n      ungroup()\n    ```\n\n### Common pitfall\nIf you write something like\n\n```r\ndf %>% mutate(\n  new_var = …,\n  .by     = c(df$id, df$date)\n)\n```\n\nyou are literally extracting the two vectors `df$id` and `df$date` (each length n) and concatenating them.  Hence the “length = 2n” complaint.  \n\n— Instead supply just the *names* of the grouping variables as in the examples above.  \n\nFinally, if you get an error saying that `.by` isn’t even an argument of `mutate()`, you’re on a version of dplyr older than 1.1.0.  Either upgrade your dplyr or use the `group_by()` + `mutate()` pattern."

'by' must be size 2909492 or 1, not 5818984.`\n\nis telling you that you have handed `.by` two full‐length vectors (id and date, each of length 2,909,492) and it has simply done\n\n```r\nc(id, date)\n#> a vector of length 2 * 2,909,492 = 5,818,984\n```\n\n– which of course is neither length one nor length 2,909,492.\n\n### What you actually want\nYou don’t want to pass the *contents* of those columns to `.by`, you want to tell dplyr “please group by these *variables*”.  There are two remedies:\n\n1)  **Use the new `.by=` argument in dplyr ≥1.1.0**  \n    Give it the column *names*, not the column values.  You can do that either unquoted or as strings.\n\n    ```r\n    # unquoted:\n    df %>%\n      mutate(\n        new_var = some_function(…),\n        .by     = c(id, date)\n      )\n\n    # or quoted:\n    df %>%\n      mutate(\n        new_var = some_function(…),\n        .by     = c(\"id\", \"date\")\n      )\n    ```\n\n2)  **If you’re on dplyr <1.1.0** (or prefer the classic syntax), just fall back to `group_by()`:\n\n    ```r\n    df %>%\n      group_by(id, date) %>%\n      mutate(new_var = some_function(…)) %>%\n      ungroup()\n    ```\n\n### Common pitfall\nIf you write something like\n\n```r\ndf %>% mutate(\n  new_var = …,\n  .by     = c(df$id, df$date)\n)\n```\n\nyou are literally extracting the two vectors `df$id` and `df$date` (each length n) and concatenating them.  Hence the “length = 2n” complaint.  \n\n— Instead supply just the *names* of the grouping variables as in the examples above.  \n\nFinally, if you get an error saying that `.by` isn’t even an argument of `mutate()`, you’re on a version of dplyr older than 1.1.0.  Either upgrade your dplyr or use the `group_by()` + `mutate()` pattern.",

The submission is missing `force(name)` before `check_dataset(dataset)`, which is explicitly mentioned in the criterion as necessary to ensure the substitution works correctly before `dataset` is evaluated.\n\n2. The submission modified how attributes are added - instead of setting attributes separately with `attr(res, \"name\") <- name`, it includes them directly in the structure() call.\n\nThe submission provides a working solution that will extract the name correctly, but it doesn't exactly follow the structure specified in the criterion. The absence of `force(name)` could lead to issues in certain edge cases where lazy evaluation might affect the substitution.\n\nThe solution also adds additional comments and shows alternative approaches using rlang, which wasn't requested in the task.\n\nGRADE: P"

If they didn’t, capture the expression of `dataset` with `substitute` (or with **rlang**’s tools).  \n\nFor example, using base R\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  ## if the user never supplied `name`, capture the call\n  if (missing(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n\n  message(\"I am going to call this task: \", name)\n  ## … your real work here, returning whatever you like …\n  list(name = name,\n       nrows = nrow(dataset),\n       dir = dir)\n}\n```\n\nNow\n\n```r\nsimple_addition <- tibble::tibble(\n  input  = c(\"What’s 2+2?\", \"What’s 2+3?\"),\n  target = c(\"4\",         \"5\")\n)\n\ntsk1 <- task_create(simple_addition)\n#> I am going to call this task: simple_addition\n\ntsk2 <- task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n#> I am going to call this task: simple_addition\n\ntsk3 <- task_create(simple_addition, name = \"foo\")\n#> I am going to call this task: foo\n```\n\nIf you don’t mind depending on **rlang**, you can write it in a slightly more “tidy” way:\n\n```r\nlibrary(rlang)\n\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  ds_expr <- enexpr(dataset)\n  if (is_null(name)) {\n    name <- as_string(ds_expr)\n  }\n  message(\"I am going to call this task: \", name)\n  # …\n  list(name = name,\n       nrows = nrow(dataset),\n       dir = dir)\n}\n```\n\nBoth approaches will give you exactly what you want: unless the user explicitly supplies `name`, you fall back to the symbol name they used for the `dataset` argument.",

Instead, it's substituted to `structure(list(input = c(\"What's 2+2?\", \"What's 2+3?\"), target = c(\"4\", , \"5\"), id = 1:2), row.names = c(NA, -2L), class = c(\"tbl_df\", , and \"tbl\", \"data.frame\"))`. How can I fix that?\n***\n[Submission]: In R it turns out that if you put\n\n  name = deparse(substitute(dataset))\n\nin your formal list, that default is *evaluated* inside the function *after* the lazy‐eval machinery has already bound `dataset` to its value, so your `substitute()` is actually seeing the *evaluated* tibble, not the bare symbol `simple_addition`.\n\nThe usual idiom is therefore to give `name` a simple default (e.g. `NULL`) and then, *inside* the body of your function, test whether the user supplied it.  If they didn’t, you grab the expression of the `dataset` argument via `substitute()` or `match.call()`.  For example:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  ## if the user didn't supply `name` use deparse(substitute(...))\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    name <- deparse(substitute(dataset))\n  }\n\n  ## now `name` will be \"simple_addition\" if the user did\n  ## task_create(simple_addition)\n  ## or task_create(dataset = simple_addition)\n\n  ## ... rest of your function ...\n  list(dataset = dataset, name = name, dir = dir)\n}\n```\n\nNow\n\n```r\ntsk <- task_create(simple_addition)\ntsk$name\n# [1] \"simple_addition\"\n```\n\nand if the user really wants to override it they can still do\n\n```r\ntask_create(simple_addition, name = \"foo_bar\")\n```\n\nBehind the scenes\n\n* `substitute(dataset)` captures the *unevaluated* R expression the user typed in for that argument.\n* `deparse()` turns it into a one‐element character vector.\n* We only call it when `name` is still `NULL`, i.e. the user didn’t override it.\n\n### An alternative with `match.call()`\n\nYou can also pull it straight out of the call if you like:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(dataset, name = NULL, dir = eval_log_dir()) {\n  if (is.null(name)) {\n    mc <- match.call()\n    ## mc$dataset is the unevaluated expression the user passed\n    name <- deparse(mc$dataset)\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n### A tidyverse / rlang solution\n\nIf you don’t mind depending on **rlang**, you can write\n\n```r\nlibrary(rlang)\n\ntask_create <- function(dataset,\n                        name = as_label(enexpr(dataset)),\n                        dir  = eval_log_dir()) {\n  ## name is now a string version of the symbol or expression\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nBut if you just want a base‐R solution, the “NULL + deparse(substitute())” trick is the simplest.\n***\n[Criterion]: The `name` default is evaluated lazily, and something else results in `dataset` being evaluated before `name` is. `name` must be evaluated early in the function, e.g. using `force(name)`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "The submission discusses the problem correctly: the default value for `name` is evaluated inside the function body after `dataset` has already been evaluated, so `substitute(dataset)` is capturing the evaluated tibble rather than the symbol.\n\nHowever, the criterion specifically mentions that:\n1. The `name` default is evaluated lazily\n2. `name` must be evaluated early in the function using `force(name)`\n\nThe submission provides several solutions:\n1. Move the default computation into the function body using `if (is.null(name))`\n2. Use `match.call()` to extract the unevaluated expression\n3. Use rlang's `enexpr()` and `as_label()`\n\nNone of these solutions actually use `force(name)` to ensure early evaluation of the name parameter. While the solutions do solve the practical problem, they don't match the specific solution approach required by the criterion.\n\nThe criterion seems to be looking for something like:\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n    dataset,\n    name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n    dir = eval_log_dir()\n) {\n    force(name)  # Force early evaluation of name\n    # rest of function\n}\n```\n\nSince the submission doesn't follow the specific approach mentioned in the criterion (using `force(name)`), despite providing working alternative solutions:\n\nGRADE: I",

This matches exactly what the criterion states.\n\nThe answer provides a complete working example that implements this fix, correctly showing:\n1. The replacement of `ns <- NS(id)` with `ns <- session$ns` in the innerServer function\n2. How this solves the issue by ensuring the namespace is correctly maintained\n3. The resulting behavior showing all components rendering properly\n\nThe submission correctly addresses the core issue of namespace hierarchy preservation when generating UI elements within modules, perfectly matching the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

Inside my `renderUI()` I call `verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\"))` and `plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))`  \n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner module:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # use session$ns, not NS(id)\n    ns <- session$ns\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something Generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))\n      ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) +\n        geom_point() +\n        ggtitle(\"A random scatter\")\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside the generated UI\"),\n        # now these IDs line up:\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  fluidRow(\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"a\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"b\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"c\")))\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"a\")\n    innerServer(\"b\")\n    innerServer(\"c\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(\n  ui = fluidPage(outer_UI(\"outer1\")),\n  server = function(input, output, session) {\n    outerServer(\"outer1\")\n  }\n)\n```\n\nNow each inner module will render:\n\n  - the static header (`h4`)\n  - the always‐visible `\"something\"`\n  - **inside** the `renderUI` slot you get the extra header, the `\"something Generated\"` text, and the plot.",

Remember:\n\n  • In the UI you should use NS(id) to create your namespaced ids  \n  • In the server, inside a moduleServer call, you should use session$ns() to get the module’s namespace, not NS(id) again.\n\nWhat you’ve done is\n\n  1. outer module “outer1” namespaces to “outer1-…”  \n  2. innerServer(“inner1”) namespaces to “outer1-inner1-…”  \n  3. then you call NS(“inner1”) again inside the server so you only get “inner1-…”  \n  4. thus your renderUI is creating tags with ids “inner1-someTextGenerated” and “inner1-theChart”  \n  5. whereas your server has actually registered output$someTextGenerated under the full name “outer1-inner1-someTextGenerated”  \n\nHence the UI never sees a matching output.\n\nThe fix is trivial – change\n\n    ns <- NS(id)\n\ninside your module server to\n\n    ns <- session$ns\n\nso that both your UI and your server agree on the *exact* same prefixed ids.  Here is a minimal worked example, I’ve also added a little colour to show the static textOutput is working.\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))  # static someText\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # <-- use session$ns, NOT NS(id)\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"this is the static someText\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"this is the generated text\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))\n      ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Chart from inside module\")\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"**Inside the Generated UI**\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  fluidRow(\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nWith that one change (using `session$ns` inside your module server) you will see\n\n  • the static `someText` below your “inner_UI:” header  \n  • the h5 header inside the renderUI  \n  • the generated verbatimTextOutput  \n  • the plotted chart\n\nall correctly namespaced."

Provides a working, corrected example\n\nThe explanation matches perfectly with the criterion, which states that `NS(id)` creates a namespace function that doesn't maintain the correct hierarchical relationship with parent modules, while `session$ns` ensures properly qualified namespaces.\n\nThe submission's change recommendation exactly matches what the criterion specifies, changing `ns <- NS(id)` to `ns <- session$ns` in the innerServer function.\n\nGRADE: C",

Here is a minimal worked example, I’ve also added a little colour to show the static textOutput is working.\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))  # static someText\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # <-- use session$ns, NOT NS(id)\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"this is the static someText\"\n    })\n\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"this is the generated text\"\n    })\n\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))\n      ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Chart from inside module\")\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"**Inside the Generated UI**\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  fluidRow(\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n    column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nWith that one change (using `session$ns` inside your module server) you will see\n\n  • the static `someText` below your “inner_UI:” header  \n  • the h5 header inside the renderUI  \n  • the generated verbatimTextOutput  \n  • the plotted chart\n\nall correctly namespaced.",

Since your Child class also creates a foo in its public list, Parent$new() tries to overwrite a locked binding and you get the error.\n\nYou have essentially two ways to “fix” this:\n\n1) **Never create foo dynamically in initialize.**  \n   If you know that Parent is going to have a foo method, just put it in Parent’s public list.  Then Child can override it in the normal way:\n\n   ```r\n   library(R6)\n\n   Parent <- R6Class(\n     \"Parent\",\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         print(\"foo from Parent\")\n       },\n       initialize = function() {\n         ## nothing special to do here\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child <- R6Class(\n     \"Child\",\n     inherit = Parent,\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         ## override\n         super$foo()\n         print(\"and then Child\")\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   c <- Child$new()\n   c$foo()\n   #> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n   #> [1] \"and then Child\"\n   ```\n\n2) **Guard your dynamic assignment so you only add foo when it doesn’t already exist.**  \n   If you really must create foo in initialize(), wrap it in an existence check so that you never clobber a foo that was already declared in the class (i.e. by Child):\n\n   ```r\n   library(R6)\n\n   Parent <- R6Class(\n     \"Parent\",\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       initialize = function() {\n         if (!\"foo\" %in% ls(self, all.names = TRUE)) {\n           self$foo <- function() {\n             print(\"foo from Parent\")\n           }\n         }\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   Child <- R6Class(\n     \"Child\",\n     inherit = Parent,\n     lock_objects = FALSE,\n     public = list(\n       foo = function() {\n         super$foo()\n         print(\"and then Child\")\n       }\n     )\n   )\n\n   c <- Child$new()\n   c$foo()\n   #> [1] \"foo from Parent\"\n   #> [1] \"and then Child\"\n   ```\n\nUnder the hood what’s happening is that R6 locks each method binding when it builds the object.  Once “foo” exists (locked) you cannot overwrite it with another `self$foo <- …` unless you first unlock that binding (which is not recommended).  By either declaring your methods up‐front in the class definition or by guarding your dynamic assignment, you avoid ever trying to overwrite a locked binding.\n***\n[Criterion]: To change a locked binding, use `unlockBinding()`, as in:\n\n```\n    initialize = function() {\n      unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n      self[[\"foo\"]] <- function() {\n        print('foo')\n      }\n    }\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

That is exactly what your Child is doing, it has its own public foo and so Parent’s initialize fails the moment it tries to overwrite it.\n\nYou really have two ways out:\n\n 1.  Don’t create foo dynamically in initialize.  If foo is part of your API and you want subclasses to override it, put it in the public list of Parent:\n\n      Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Parent\",\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public = list(\n          foo = function() {\n            cat(\"foo\\n\")\n          },\n          initialize = function() {\n            ## …anything else you really need to do on new()\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      Child <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Child\",\n        inherit    = Parent,\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public     = list(\n          foo = function() {\n            super$foo()\n            cat(\"and then Child does its bit\\n\")\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      c <- Child$new()\n      c$foo()\n      #> foo\n      #> and then Child does its bit\n\n 2.  If you absolutely must *inject* a new foo at runtime in Parent’s initialize you have to un‐lock that one binding yourself (and then re‐lock it if you really care), e.g.:\n\n      Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Parent\",\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public = list(\n          initialize = function() {\n            if (bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n              unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n            }\n            self$foo <- function() {\n              cat(\"foo\\n\")\n            }\n            lockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      Child <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Child\",\n        inherit      = Parent,\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public       = list(\n          foo = function() {\n            super$foo()\n            cat(\"child\\n\")\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      c <- Child$new()\n      c$foo()\n      #> foo\n      #> child\n\nbut frankly option (1) is almost always the cleaner design in R6.

If you absolutely must *inject* a new foo at runtime in Parent’s initialize you have to un‐lock that one binding yourself (and then re‐lock it if you really care), e.g.:\n\n      Parent <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Parent\",\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public = list(\n          initialize = function() {\n            if (bindingIsLocked(\"foo\", self)) {\n              unlockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n            }\n            self$foo <- function() {\n              cat(\"foo\\n\")\n            }\n            lockBinding(\"foo\", self)\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      Child <- R6::R6Class(\n        \"Child\",\n        inherit      = Parent,\n        lock_objects = FALSE,\n        public       = list(\n          foo = function() {\n            super$foo()\n            cat(\"child\\n\")\n          }\n        )\n      )\n\n      c <- Child$new()\n      c$foo()\n      #> foo\n      #> child\n\nbut frankly option (1) is almost always the cleaner design in R6.

There are three really easy fixes:\n\n1) Rename the outer argument so it can’t collide:\n\n   ```r\n   generate <- function(initial_chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n     function(input, chat = initial_chat) {\n       ch  <- chat$clone()\n       res <- ch$chat(input)\n       list(result = res, chat = ch)\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2) Force the outer chat immediately and then use the same name:\n\n   ```r\n   generate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n     force(chat)     # evaluate the promise now\n     function(input, chat = chat) {\n       ch  <- chat$clone()\n       res <- ch$chat(input)\n       list(result = res, chat = ch)\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3) Don’t even give the inner function a default for “chat” – just close over it:\n\n   ```r\n   generate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n     force(chat)\n     function(input) {\n       ch  <- chat$clone()\n       res <- ch$chat(input)\n       list(result = res, chat = ch)\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nAny of these will eliminate the “promise already under evaluation” error.\n***\n[Criterion]: It can be fixed by changing the name of the `chat` argument in one of the functions or assigning the `chat` object in the outer function to a different variable name internally and then supplying that renamed object as the default to the inner function.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

              "response": "I'll assess if the submission meets the criterion of correctly identifying and fixing the issue with the `output$plot` in the anonymous server function.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the key issue: in the original code, `output$plot` and other reactive expressions are defined outside the server function, but then only `output$plot` is referenced (not defined) inside the server function passed to `shinyApp()`. This is precisely why the error \"Can't read output 'plot'\" occurs.\n\nThe solution provided in the submission:\n1. Correctly moves all reactive expressions and the `output$plot` definition inside a proper server function\n2. Updates the server function to take `input` and `output` parameters\n3. Correctly calls `shinyApp()` with the defined server function rather than an anonymous function\n4. Properly shows how to reference input values using `input$condition` and `input$visit_threshold` inside the server function\n\nThis solution addresses the exact issue identified in the criterion: \"There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function.\" The submission properly demonstrates how to move the rendering code into a proper server function.\n\nThe solution is complete and would fix the error described in the original problem.\n\nGRADE: C",

                  "text": "The reason you are getting “Can’t read output ‘plot’” is that you never actually *define* `output$plot` inside the `server()` function that you hand off to `shinyApp()`.  In your example you created all of your `reactive()`s and your `renderPlot()` in the global environment, then you called\n\n```r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = function(input,output){\n  output$plot\n})\n```\n\nwhich is effectively an empty server function.  Shiny looks inside your server function for something of the form\n\n```r\noutput$plot <- renderPlot({ … })\n```\n\nand, not finding it, complains that it can’t read “plot”.\n\n---\n\nTo fix it, pull all of your reactive expressions and your `renderPlot()` *into* your server function.  For example:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# load your data once\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(CKD_STAGE = str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\"))\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  choices = c(\"CKD 3\",\"CKD 4\",\"CKD 5\",\"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # a single reactive that does your filtering\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold >= 0)\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(CKD_STAGE    == input$condition,\n             VISIT_COUNT >  input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # now *inside* server we assign output$plot\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No rows meet your filter criteria\")\n    )\n    ggplot(data,\n           aes(x = VISIT_COUNT,\n               y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\",\n           y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# finally hand ui & server to shinyApp\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\nKey points:\n\n1.  Everything that uses `input` or that assigns to `output$…` *must* live inside the `server <- function(input,output,session){…}` block.\n2.  Call your reactives inside `server` with `()` ( e.g. `filtered_data()` ), not as bare names.\n3.  The call to `shinyApp(ui, server)` must reference that server function you just built.",

          "explanation": "I need to evaluate if the submitted answer correctly identifies the issue in the Shiny app code according to the criterion.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies the core problem: the `output$plot` is only being accessed but not assigned in the server function. Instead, the `renderPlot()` code is defined outside the server function in the global environment, which is why the app can't find the plot output.\n\nThe submission proposes the correct solution of moving all reactive expressions and the `renderPlot()` assignment into a proper server function, showing how `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})` should be structured inside the server function. The solution also correctly demonstrates:\n\n1. Moving all reactive logic inside the server function\n2. Properly assigning the renderPlot to output$plot\n3. Using proper syntax for calling reactive values with parentheses\n4. Structuring the shinyApp call correctly\n\nThe submission's proposed fix aligns with the criterion, which also emphasizes moving the plot rendering code inside a proper server function. The restructuring approach is essentially the same as what's shown in the criterion.\n\nGRADE: C",

Here’s a minimal working example of how you can reorganize your app:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & rename data outside of shiny\nKidney_Correlations_Data <-\n  read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\") %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  mutate(CKD_STAGE =\n           str_replace(.[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\"))\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\",\n                  \"Select CKD Condition:\",\n                  c(\"CKD 3\",\"CKD 4\",\"CKD 5\",\"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\",\n                   \"Minimum Visit Count:\",\n                   value = 5,\n                   min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  # reactives must be called with ()\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>%\n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE    == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT  >  input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data)>0, \"No rows survive that filter.

We defined `server <- function(input, output, session) { … }` rather than inlining a server function that does nothing.\n2.  All of your `reactive(...)` and `renderPlot(...)` calls live inside that `server` function.\n3.  When you refer to a reactive you must call it with `()`, or just use `input$…` directly inside your expressions.\n4.  Finally you hand the pair `(ui, server)` to `shinyApp()`.\n\nWith that structure in place you will no longer get “Can’t read output ‘plot’.”\n***\n[Criterion]: There's a `output$plot` alone in the anonymous server function. The solution is to move the `output$plot` and rendering code into a proper server function, like:\n\n```\n# ...same ui\n\nserver <- function(input, output) {\n  # Create reactive functions to filter the data based on user input\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(CKD_STAGE == input$condition, VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold)\n  })\n  \n  # Create a linear model and visualization\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    validate(\n      need(input$condition != \"\", \"Please select a condition\"),\n      need(input$visit_threshold > 0, \"Please enter a valid visit threshold\")\n    )\n                                   # Filter the data based on the user's input\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n                                   # Create a linear model\n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n                                   # Create a plot of the linear model\n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",

If it isn’t there, you get NULL, so `%||%` will fall back to the old token.  \n 3. You no longer accidentally pull in `refresh_token_expires_in`.  \n\nIf you want to be really paranoid you can also turn on partial‐match warnings (or even errors) with:  \n```r\noptions(\n  warnPartialMatchDollar = TRUE,\n  warnPartialMatchAttr   = TRUE\n)\n```  \nbut switching to `[[` is the simplest and most bulletproof cure.",

A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.",
              "response": "I need to assess if the submission meets the criterion, which specifically asks for using `str_replace()` twice in order (once for the first pair of pipes and once for the second).\n\nLooking at the submission, the person provided three different solutions:\n\n1. Using `separate()` and `paste0()`\n2. Chaining two `str_replace()` calls\n3. Using a single `str_replace()` with capture groups\n\nThe second solution matches the criterion almost exactly:\n\n```r\npipe %>%\n  mutate(\n    result = appointment_key %>%\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"T\") %>%   # 1st || → \"T\"\n      str_replace(\"\\\\|\\\\|\", \"A\")        # 2nd || → \"A\"\n  )\n```\n\nThis solution correctly:\n- Uses `str_replace()` twice (not `str_replace_all()`)\n- Applies them in order, first replacing one instance of `||` with \"T\", then replacing the next instance with \"A\"\n- Creates the correct result\n\nThe only minor difference from the criterion example is that it assigns to a new column `result` rather than modifying `appointment_key` directly, but the criterion explicitly states \"A correct solution can either assign to `appointment_key` or `result`.\"\n\nThe submission correctly demonstrates the understanding of how to use `str_replace()` twice to replace specific instances of a pattern.\n\nGRADE: C",
